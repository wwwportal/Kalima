# ✅ Novel Premise:
In a modern city layered with centuries of history, a reclusive systems theorist becomes obsessed with decoding a "theory of everything"—not in physics, but in meaning itself. As the city pulses around him, digital signals, architectural echoes, and voices from the long-dead begin to converge. He believes he's uncovering a hidden language woven through history, technology, and myth. But is he on the brink of revelation—or delusion?
