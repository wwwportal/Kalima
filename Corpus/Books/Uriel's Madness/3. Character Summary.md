# ✅ Step 3: Characters Summary

---

### 1. **Uriel**

* **Core Function:** Protagonist. Our lens into Prague, the mystery, and the theory-of-everything-through-symbols.
* **Psychological Conflict:** Constantly balancing skepticism with a deep pull toward mystical interpretation.
* **Spiritual Dimension:** Begins to intuit that the world is constructed out of patterned information, possibly sentient.
* **Practical Arc:** From failed academic to private seeker; from software to symbology.
* **Key Internal Struggle:** Does he trust his mind—when everything is beginning to look like a message?

### 2. **Miroslava**

* **Core Function:** The rationalist anchor and emotional wildcard.
* **Contrast to Uriel:** Prefers tangible simulations over metaphysical implications.
* **Emotional Tone:** Sarcastic, intense, magnetic. A flirtation with nihilism wrapped in brilliance.
* **Arc:** Potentially drifts away and returns at key times. Her bipolarity makes her vanish when needed most.
* **Key Function:** Challenges Uriel’s theories with sharp skepticism—but may be the first to glimpse their potential under pressure.

### 3. **Ivo**

* **Core Function:** Foil and mirror to Uriel—both seek meaning, but Ivo externalizes paranoia Uriel internalizes.
* **Tone:** Charismatic and manic, sometimes comic relief, sometimes uncomfortably on-the-nose.
* **Thematic Role:** Embodies the danger of finding *too many* patterns. He’s what Uriel fears becoming.
* **Narrative Utility:** Introduces wild conspiracy theories that later, strangely, echo actual symbols Uriel finds.

Let’s keep a small cast for clarity. These three form a compelling triangulation of:

* **Skeptical Mind (Miroslava)**
* **Obsessed Seeker (Uriel)**
* **Deluded Knower (Ivo)**
