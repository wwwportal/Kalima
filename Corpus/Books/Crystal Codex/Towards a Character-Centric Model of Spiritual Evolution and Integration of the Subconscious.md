# Towards a Character-Centric Model of Spiritual Evolution and Integration of the Subconscious

## collective or individual
Should we focus on the collective or the individual? For some years now, I've focused largely on how groups of people communicate and organize each other. However, I noticed many problems with this fixation. As the book La Pschologie des Foules by Gustave Le Bon asserts, crowds have an identity of their own. The identity of the individual gets, as it was, absorbed by the crowd. The crowd as a whole acts very differently than each individual would have on their own. The book mentions the inherent inability of a crowd to direct itself. Many faults can be found in this collective cognitive structure's operations when evaluated against, for example, the crowd's necessity to solve its problems efficiently.

At the same time, it's impossible for individuals to accomplish by themself what millions of people together can. And most if not all scientific discoveries represent the work of a few built on the works of many others who came before them. It may have served as a theoretical foundation or even a set of observations to disprove.

## The Ideal Self
- A vision at the root of our consciousness: the ideal self is an abstract entity composed of all we believe to be true at the core of our being.
- Though humans have made a lot of progress on the cognitive front, all of our abstract ideas are fundamentally based on our embodied experiences. (See George Lakoff's Metaphors We Live By).

### The Invisible God
like a fish in water, the beliefs we hold on to most firmly in our core are often invisible to us. They are treated as ground truth and self-evident axioms from which we make sense of everything else.

## A Sculpted Idol
many of our idols are manufactured by the most influential thought leaders. Most thought leaders possess conflicts of interest, and the ideal self they sell us might be in fact the kind that gives them more power or enriches them materially.

While being careful to recognize the limits of science, we would like a rigorous approach to the evaluation of the characters we praise or slander.

## The Living Sculpture
No human has complete knowledge, and we expect the possibility of defining ever-greater characters as the core evolves.

This is another important justification for the need of a solid framework to evaluate characters.

## The Character Sheet
What set of elements are necessary and sufficient to understand and evaluate a character? This is a very tough question to answer, and many people have come up with various sets of elements they consider the most important.

## Co-creating your Story
- How much time do people take to reflect on their own character and that of others?
- How often do people update their perception of their own character or that of others?
- What factors can lead to stagnating character development in a person's and what works in breaking these barriers?
- What are the benefits

## A focus on character analysis in the context of narratives as a path to self-actualization
using stories to learn analyzing characters may help earthlings (see glossary) in bridging the voids in their lives, fix their bad habits, and move society's attention away from judgement based on superficial traits and instead focus more on the traits that really matter for individual health, with the assumption that the holistic character development of individuals leads to a healthier society.
