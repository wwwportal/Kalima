# Self-Configuration

## Defining the core of the self
### What is the self composed of?
### What remains once the body perishes?

## Crossing Over to The Metaphorical Understanding
### the world was created as a referent for humans to develop language
### the relation between the concrete and the abstract, within the context of self-processing and self-configuration as the primary goals of existence

## Bridging the Metaphorical with the Personal
### Applying metaphors to different facets of the Self

## Detachment from the physical body
### how attachment to the body amplifies stress and anxiety
once you feel that you are in the body, you experience the zappies in the body.
those experiences that cannot be explained using rational thinking will torture you if you forget that they should not be analyzed with reason. The consequence of this forgetfulness is fragmentation of the self as you repeatedly ram your head against the experience, thinking that will help you unravel its meaning.
my identity should not be tied to the body. But, then, what should it be tied to? Simply by rising above the body, a heavy weight is lifted off my chest.

### the metaphor of lightness and floating up

## The Desired Outcome: self-configuration to maximize the utility function of the primary telon
### a methodological approach to self-configuration
### the potential for creating tools to assist in self-configuration
### a survey of existing useful technologies for self-configuration
### self-configuration beyond technology and the potential benefits thereof
