# The SuperStory

## Introduction
This is going to be an unstructured conversation about cybernetics of social systems. I want to explain first why or how I got interested in in in Social systems in the first place and that eventually led me to um complex systems in. 

I was listening to all these conspiracy theories and we're all familiar with the most famous ones. In general the idea is that there are people who are controlling the world. I don't necessarily believe that in the same way that many people. In any case that led me to ask a hypoehtsis: if they did control us then they they must have developed a science of human control.

beings the general narrative that I held on to before the story that I lived in before was mainly that this control was excuse me that this control was maintained by um by the m media by programming the Mind mind mind control and all of this and yeah you know like we're familiar with this MK Ultra and and how these symbols okay but how do they know how to use these symbols and and media to to change your change the way you think you can say it's just psychology but I think that makes sense when you're talking just about one individual like okay we want you to think this way we want you to have these kinds of ideas maybe even these kinds of behaviors yeah but you know you in the bigger

picture we want to from the pers perspective of the governors we want to instill specific behaviors in different groups in order to reach a specific outcome a specific goal and to do that is much more difficult and complex because there's a just a lot more variables so uh a lot of things can go wrong

I knew or I I I believed for a for a long time that language played a big role in this at first it was for reasons that you might disagree with but I reading all these ancient texts on Magic and mythologies and B you can call them whatever you want the stories that uh that ancient civilizations um used as to make sense of the world you know these stories that essentially play the role of paradigms or mental schemas for the

people these stories themselves could could be said to have been used to control the minds of people okay but um yeah so stories are used in this way and we already mentioned that we said me the media and the media uses stories to um you know give you programs in your mind where you basically become used to uh relating specific stimulus stimuli with spec with a specific response es you know you see a character over and over again reacting the same way to a a a type of situation and if that's all that you have seen before or if that's the biggest influence in your life then when you uh encounter a similar situation you're more likely to act the same way that the character uh reacted react in the same way that character in the movie reacted okay so we need to make engage engaging stories that people can relate to so that they can um they can become one they can identify with a character and once the movie is gone the identity is still there and in the back of their head is going to be triggered whenever the situation is the trigger and whenever the sit uh whenever a s similar situation occurs the identity is pulled up from the subconscious it looks at okay which behavior was ass the identity Associates uh Associates a situation and a behavior right and uh once the situation occurs uh then the identity tells you oh you have to act this way

okay so uh I'm I'm a Muslim I follow the Quran and I try to understand how to apply it because the way I see it most uh

it's it's all it's it's forgotten by most Muslims it's just it's treated like garbage in the sense that we're not trying to really apply it uh Faithfully we just follow what the priests say and so on and I mean that's a whole other topic I don't want to get there go there but

uh okay I think that there's a way there's a

um there's a similar kind of software or program in the Quran that Associates uh specific situations with with specific behaviors or reactions and this uh by the way check out the YouTube channel marvelous Quran um it's not not saying exactly what I'm saying because I don't want

to I don't want to say something that's different you know distorting it with with my own P perspective and then claiming that that's what the original message is so this is these are my

thoughts but yeah the Quran has these um design for a system kind of a blueprint and the way I think of this is It's a language of creation a language of Creation in the sense that you know as some people have said you might have heard this before if if you're in the same kind of um cognitive space that I am in that I float in or epistemic space that I'm in then you might have reached the same conclusion that life is more like a story than it is like physics or mathematics mathematics yeah exactly um and there's you know Terrence McKenna said said basically the same thing and other people um alluded to the same thing to the same concept

okay uh So based on that I was thinking how do you

like once you have those stories then what do you do with them there must be a way to convert stories into reality and reality back into stories well the first one you know realities into stories that's really important for for the first time when I mean the first time before this practice is developed and by practice practice I mean I mean it in the same way that it's used in the book anathem by Neil Stenson so that's probably not very useful because it's a book of fiction and uses words a bit differently if you're familiar with that book but um it's a practice a discipline you can say yeah so a

discipline so how do we develop there there should be a discipline

for extracting stories from the universe into written text let's just say that into language and then from language story uh written

language from a written story back into the universe therefore understanding and then application okay or creation

yeah um I have I had some ideas about this but I don't know if I want to get into them right now what I really wanted to do right now I mentioned earlier is delve a bit deeper into the background for all these thoughts that I've had and kind of refresh my own mind on on on the role that cybernetics plays in this especially in in social policy um yeah so a quick comment to relate this to the to what I was saying earlier is that you know when you have this story it's like a a crystallized version of of the reality and from this crystallized version you can have like the protocol for for the reality that you want and the protocol says these are the good situations or the good outcomes that we want these are the the bad outcom that we want to avoid and kind of like how to reach each one and how to deal with each one of those but the system itself is free is free to to choose whichever direction it wants and the the story should be able to provide context and uh um you know insights for any kind of situations where wherever the system goes then someone who understands the story correctly should be able to navigate that system however it is where whether it's closer to the uh Co U whether

it's whether it's a harmonia system or not someone who understands the story should be able to navigate that uh as well as as as can be as it can be navigated you know because sometimes it's you can only do so much so I'm gonna share my screen and uh we're gonna go through a paper maybe a few papers I haven't read this these before so they may or may not be completely um relevant but uh I trust that they will be you know like I said this is not really a structured video uh it's more of a

it's more me trying to make sense of these thoughts so yeah you're welcome to join basically but don't expect this to be structured and oh and

uh okay gonna go full screen oops

yeah uh so this this paper is called modeling a sociopolitical system for Public Policy

cybernetics by par Paris arop pulos bro I'm I'm pretty bad with names professor emeritus Concordia University Montreal Canada abstract so this is interesting just the the location because I've I've noticed even Stafford beer uh mentioned I don't know was he in was he in Canada for some for a while Vancouver I believe in Montreal as well Toronto yeah anyways there seems to be a lot of people around this these places in Canada that uh that have had a big role to play in in building the system that is currently in place or that is that is uh being built okay mathematical modeling in the social sciences is concentrated so far um in economics leaving politics behind based on a recent Paradigm of sociophysics this article attempts an interdisciplinary General System model that combines all three social sectors economics politics and ethnics and okay and I'll make um so my comment like why why mathematics why engineering why so this is related to the video that I wanted to make before and this video is supposed to be the context for that video video but it seems we're going to have to get into that topic anyways so I just the previous video was supposed to be to be me trying to make sense of the the things I've come upon the the threads that I see connected together but I don't know exactly what what role they play in the bigger picture and this is the series is supposed to be me trying to make out what the how they relate to the bigger picture um or why they're even present in the picture why they seem to be to to be taking such a prominent role in the in the picture this might just be me you're gonna say and uh some of some of you might say and that may be so but that's the way that I see it and I've I've had a and I've read like a lot of different topics and it seems to appear in all of these different topics it might be farfetched maybe not but in any case what I'm saying here is that somehow people uh I felt this urge through all of these things I knew that Technology and Engineering was the way that they were trying to crystallize this this Divine knowledge into in order to make it useful for themselves for their agenda so if you have an agenda is and all this mystical knowledge is so fuzzy and and you know difficult to handle then what you want to do or what they want to do is to simplified as much as possible you know formalize it into a mathematical system uh or mathematical model and be able to compute it okay and obviously some of these things are not really easily computable so maybe that's why we need um Quantum Computing and so on and eventually human computation but we're not going to get into that today not that I really understand it fully and that's one of the reasons why we're not going to get into it but

um um but yeah for some reason I also feel that urge to to make it into a mathematical model and I want understand why that is one of the reasons is that I'm going to Computer Engineering I'm studying Computer Engineering uh but I just started recently and this interest came before that interest that desire is what led me to go into computer engineering so is it even possible am

I am I doing something Wrong by pursuing this goal am I wasting my time essentially is there could I be doing something better with my life to help this whole system come together and harmonize maybe maybe not but this is what these people are trying to do they're trying to um make it predictable or if not predictable at least steerable that's what cybernetic is all about okay and to do that as Stafford beer mentioned you have to have a you have to atten ATT anyway to the complexity of the of the environment um the system that that wants to control its environment uh okay so if you have two systems if I'm a system and I want to control another system that is incredibly complex I need some way to attenuate to reduce the complexity of that outside system in order to to be able to steer it more properly you know to reduce the number of a variable so that when I change something it doesn't just blow up the whole thing or or goes off somewhere that you know completely off yeah you get okay so let's keep

reading um to do so this preliminary study proceeds by a formalization of systems theory along with its structures and functions another like I'm not I'm not that good in formal informal systems like with the symbolism uh not the symbolism like um symbolic logic and all that I'm not a master of that at all so I might have difficulty with this but let's keep going we'll see because of its white scope the model is necessarily theoretical and fundamental leaving specifics to later speal specialized studies as such this primary attempt incorporates the concepts of political power and economic wealth into the same model thus indicating a simple way to approach a more realistic representation of

society uh we have theoretical systems functional systems analytical methods okay model model building is a wellestablished activity in many disciplines models try to describe or explain or prescribe particular aspects or of structures or processes with a view to improving our understanding or control of various systems the complexity of reality however has always limited limited the modeling process in depth or breadth one could either model greater detail but a but narrow application or wide generality but little

exactitude this trade-off between quality and quantity is perhaps the n in the nature of things but the task Still Remains to try and optimize these two one way to do this is by the judicious judicious use of mathematics as a symbolic language mathematics adds rigor to our Concepts and thus p more information with greater validity economists above all social scientists have gone quite far in using mathematics for this purpose but their Endeavors are restricted to one sector of human activity this uneven development has Le has left great gaps of systematic knowledge in the social sciences and limited economic models to a one-dimensional mode presently therefore we have reached the stage where economic models should be expanded expanded to include broader concerns or general social systems models must be developed to include the economic subsystem among others this paper makes a first attempt to combine both economic and political concerns in a single and simp simple formal model this means that it interfaces the flow of wealth and power attempting to explain how they affect public policym okay converting money into influence and vice versa is one of the most important transaction in Social systems and thus is worthy of our efforts okay so this concept and I'm not reading anymore this concept of translating of converting money into influence and vice versa influence into money is something that uh Alison McDow has been exploring in some of her of her of her videos and I don't fully understand the financial aspect of this I don't really understand the financial system as as well uh as I should but I uh uh I'm just going to throw out a few keywords that you guys can look up and look up our videos as well about you know social impact bonds uh human computation um and and all of these things being put into blockchains and um yeah that's is that's as far as I can really go into this right

now at the same time of course they are extremely difficult to exchange rigorously yet some attempt has been made to gain more experience to trueu or representation of reality the procedure followed here gives a pre brief introduction to systems theory upon which is based our mathematical construct with this symbolic descrip description of a social system we then present a mathematical analysis of its operations and finally conclude by focusing on their political economic interactions what follows then is based is a basic introduction to a continuing project of social modeling following three logical steps system structure and function okay structure and function is something that we've thought about before the as far as I'm concerned the function relates to the semantics and structure relates to the syntax of a language or of reality and all of this it can be uh the structure or function of a system okay so the social system this study looks at Social or at society as a system there are various ways of defining these two terms but we choose one of the simplest definitions to begin with a system is a set of units or a group of interrelated components real systems like society exist in a spatial temporal framework for society the spatial environment is e ecology and the temporal environment is history the Earth is the natural environment of the world society which is made up of many distinct social systems represented sociopolitical by its 200 nation states as we Define it a society as a set of human actors and their actions a social system is therefore a human group interrelating and interacting within a geographical space over a period of time and this is why I said it seems to me that you know we should think of this as a

story it seems to me that we should be able to find the mathematical structure of a story of a good story we say okay this is you know when I say a good story I mean like a prescriptive story of what should be done when you have a scripture uh Divine scripture then what you what you're reading in it in it are examples of stories of what to do and what not to do and then you could maybe abstract that into its mathematical structure and then once you have this cybernetic model of of society uh mathematical model of society using cybernetics or what or whatever then maybe you can map those two together if we know how to use cybernetics to influence the the structure and and function of this social story and we know that this that the the goal story is this a scriptural story that we have then maybe we can map those two together through using you know tweaking the social system um using I don't know what exactly we might be able to see that you know using money and influence um but exactly how do we do that that's one the topics that we're going to be exploring in the future but I'm still kind of perplexed by how this relates specifically to the language as in I don't know how to take a story and then extract its mathematical structure and then apply that to a a complex dynamic system that can make any decision it wants you know it can go left it can go right but then how do you steer the system such that at some point it reaches it it follows the same paths as the story you want it to follow or if it if it um deres or not deres but if it veers off from that track then how do you bring it back back into track using the self-correction mechanism to to then uh to then build a harmonious Society yeah that's kind of the the train of the train of thought that I've been having okay the social system is therefore a human group uh enter okay since humans are both logical and biological hold on yeah persisting or prolonged prolonged prolong prolonged prolonged interactions interrelations so persistent or prolonged intera interrelations form the structure of society while the repetitive or continuous interactions form its process since humans are both logical and biological systems they have needs and wants focused upon their P upon their perceived self-interest in survival in that sense societies are Creations that serve to fulfill the necessities of physical life and the desires of human imagination because of this functional characteristic social systems develop their capacity ities to produce exchange uh social systems develop their capacities to produ produce exchange and distribute various Goods or values for human consumption Society through different specialized organs and techniques extracts matter and energy from its environment and transforms them into Commodities that can maintain its members according to their culture or way of of life so when I read this passage it reminded me that I want to I want to specify that when I talk about designing a social system I yes we can talk about the structure of like the infrastructure and but but I mean specifically the structure and function of communication channels how information is passed on from one entity to another because as far as I can tell from my readings uh of um ancient stories it seems to me that most of these things that are usually considered or interpreted as meths are actually talking about the psychology the development of the psychology or the cognition of individuals therefore um it's about epistemology how do we learn about things how do we learn about the world and learn to navigate the world to master the world and uh I I believe there therefore that these stories uh are are lay laying out for us how we should relate to one another as far as information is concerned that itself will later on eventually inform our decision making uh in in the physical space in in the economic space as far as the exchange of various goods and services is concerned but I feel as far as I'm concerned uh information processing and the exchange of information is where I am is what I care

about uh okay because of this functional characteristic social systems develop their okay Society through different specialized organs and techniques man I know my voice is not the best is not the easiest to understand

I'm sorry about that Society through different specialized organs and techniques extracts matter and energy from its environment and transforms them into Commodities that can maintain its members according to their culture or way of life the various specialized functions of society may be grouped into three distinct sectors economy community and polity the first forms the infrastructure of the system and produces its goods and services which we're talking about the economy the second form forms its structure and consumes its the products finally the third forms its superstructure and regulates or controls the overall operations of the system

okay so bringing this once again back to the cognitive perspective and not the uh literal perspective because I'm all about the symbolism of of these stories and these systems like I'm all about the informational layer okay you get it so what do I mean uh when I look at the first one economy community and POC when I look at economy and I see it's described as the forms the infrastructure of the system and produces its goods and services okay what I what I understand by this is uh well produces its good and services when I think of goods and services I think of information I think of knowledge so this is the layer that focuses on producing knowledge and um yeah producing a better understanding of reality the second one Community is the for of the structure and consumes the product so I I don't fully understand the infrastructure so I don't know exactly how to translate it to this uh cognitive system uh but the second which is the community forms that structure and consumes the products and I see imagine this as like different nodes in the system and obviously the information the goods and services are moving from one to another and I guess you can think of this as infrastructure so I don't I I I just don't understand what's the difference between the structure and infrastructure here uh but the community forms the nodes and the system that consume the information and so if the economy produces the produces and the community consumes then you can think of the economy as the teachers or the in the ancient world ancient stories it's the priest class the class of saints and philosophers and so on the intellectual class the theoretic uh the r rors retors as and as Neil Stenson would say in anathem um so there's that class of teachers and the class of students which learn from the teachers so the the economy is the class of teachers and the community is the class of of students and the Pol is is on top has to be on top of both of them because it informs how the whole thing works how information ex is exchanged between the two how each layer organizes itself and yeah okay the second forms yeah the the finally the third forms its super structure and regulates or controls the overall operations of the system right and obviously this would it's it's similar to the protocols in in computer networking where you have different rules for how information is sent to who it's sent when it's sent uh what happens yeah this is important what to do when something goes wrong right like if because the protocol kind of outlines what the story should be actually it outlines both stories like I said the scripture outlines prescriptively what should be done and what should not be done the the the ideals story and the Not So ideal Story the one that you want to avoid you know so the protocol kind of gives us the same thing because it tells us um if this happens then that's the result if uh you know then maybe be successful if it's successful if the process the the transfer of information is successful then what do you do if it's not successful then what do you do then and we have all sorts of consequences for each one of those and that's the polity polity layer okay the diagram below illustrates some of the concepts defined and simplified here the main structures of a typical Society are shown as triangles while a significant processes are shown as arrows within the large triangle or smaller or three smaller triangles representing the economic cultural and and political sectors of society the arrows for uh from and to each triangle show the interactions between them as well as between the system and its environment for our purpose we distinguish two main types of interactions because these two types reflect the most important flows in society one is money representing the exchange of wealth and among uh among its sectors the other is influence and represents the impact of power in the system [Music]

yeah I don't know exactly what you know can we say that money and influence are

also anyways

let's Okay since the purpose of the study is to show how these flow flows U interact we proceed to formalize the structures and functions of the social system and then simulate its operations in these terms so as you see here we have this we have a social system the system is interacting with its environment and it is composed of or I don't know is it composed of or interacts with these different things I would say the social system is composed of the economy community and polity and the system social system as a whole interacts with its environments using these three things

okay we now try to translate the verbal Theory into in of the social system formulated in the pr preceding chapter into a formal model utilizing mathematics as a collection of axioms or postulates from which certain consequences or conclusions follow according to a strict algorithmic code this is also this is a problem as far as certain of these some of this these things that are about Consciousness are concerned that they don't really follow algorithmic algorithmic processes so how how do we how do we model it using algorithms really there's no way of doing that but there needs to be a as Chris Langan would say a protoc computational a protoc computation that that works and I I think this is why we're going to need to use that if we can't use computers if computers don't have that ability then we're going to need to use humans in the loop they're going to Human are going to have to be in the loop in order to to form these kinds of computations because part of the computation is not physical is is is non-physical and therefore cannot be computational does not follow the same kinds of processes that matter does you

know uh okay since a model is a representation of certain aspects of reality and some simp and some simp simplified form a mathematical model is an abstract construct that reflects some phenomena or situations in the real world uh real world by representing and manipulating them symbolically with this in mind we let us choose s to represent the social system and in its natural environment as it as a structural functional system Society possesses or desires certain traits or values if we let G represent these characteristics hold on which characteristics

yeah

certain Society possesses or uh or desire certain traits or values what are those States traits or values we don't know yet but let's say that we represented them by G and then H then either s possesses G as its identity or tries to attain it as its goal right right right and so that's what I was saying so s in this case uh no G in this case certain traits desirable traits and values and I'm saying that this is represented by a story you have in the scripture a story that you say this is what the good system looks like and it's described in various ways and and we're told that if we do certain things we're going to get certain rewards pointing to the fact that this that this are these are the desire uh desires uh um these are the the traits and values that we should desire that the social system should desire and obviously we have the opposite the the counterpart of this the the uh yeah which tells us which actually we can use to verify to to measure how far off we are from the desired traits and values and this is important when we have something like a homeostatic or or a we when we're looking for when you know you need this feedback loop where you look at the environment you ask a question am I closer to my goal yes or no you go back inside and fix the internal State and then you check again with the environment am I have I reached that state yet yet or not you keep doing that until you reach that state of of homeostasis

okay if s can maintain a certain uh yeah so if s can maintain a set of G traits in spite of any disturbance or opposition then it is set to be be persisting or homeostatic if it is moving toward G as its goal it is developing or teleonomic social systems always strive to attain or maintain some G therefore they can be conceived of conceived or characterized in terms of a combination of their gstate values I.E security welfare quality of life and sovereignty Etc and and in the cognitive system that I'm talking about it would be certain desirable States or certain traits of a good information system so first we these are described in the scripture as you know a certainty um Clarity um the ability to self-correct having this methodology and the mastering the craft of of of uh of composition composing different ideas together and logic is part of this as well so these are all traits and obviously honesty because I want to add values here if we add values you're obviously going to have things like like honesty sincerity avail a ability uh which means like keeping yourself available to receive new information um I mentioned humility anyways you understand so there are there are U parallels between these two things but uh yeah my voice is getting pretty my my U I'm gonna have to stop now this is one of the other reasons I want to do this more often because I spent so much time not speaking that I feel like I uh you know my vocal cords are not getting the training that they need and I I do want to be able to express this more clearly with practice uh perhaps in the future I'll be able to express myself more clearly so that you can understand and because that's my goal and obviously this is not a I'm not teaching you

something even though you may learn something from these from this segment my goal is not to prescribe something my goal is to explore this with you with myself and with whoever is present with me and to get some sort of feedback feedback from you this is what I want most to get any corrections if I've said anything wrong and so on and I'm sorry to the author of this paper that I haven't asked for their permission it's just uh I hope I hope it's not taken in the wrong way okay thank

you uh so first I'm gonna stop sharing the

screen uh but yeah I'm probably going to continue reading the same paper next time or maybe a different one but I think you're starting to get a taste for what this what uh what I'm talking about right um hopefully if not now if not yet then we'll continue building the picture this is the purpose of this these segments it's that I feel like we have all these Concepts and they're they're not really put together very clearly as of yet and I want to put them together for my own sake for your primarily just to make to clarify for myself because I um I feel like I can kind of glimp get a glimpse at the full picture but I have to be able to speak it to articulate it in order to to actually be sure that I understand it and to evaluate my own thoughts about it because I may think that I understand it but once I articulate it then it becomes uh then we can actually evaluate what I said analyze it break it down into pieces and um see how logical how coherent the whole story is and hopefully you can give me some critiques and

uh I know there's going to be trolls and stuff like that anyways that's all thank you see you next time for
