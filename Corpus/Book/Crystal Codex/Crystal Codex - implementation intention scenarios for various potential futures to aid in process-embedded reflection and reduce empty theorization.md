# Crystal Codex - implementation intention scenarios for various potential futures to aid in process-embedded reflection and reduce empty theorization

## scenario-based rather than attribute based enables more flexibility and intuitive understanding of how to apply insights

## tight feedback loop: scenario-based approach closes the gap between theorization and implementation

## what is a scenario?
### a scenario could be a set of variables and their assigned values.
### if that's the case, then what set of variables should we track?
### variables are attributes. therefore, the variables to use are the attributes we wrote in the Crytsal Codex.
