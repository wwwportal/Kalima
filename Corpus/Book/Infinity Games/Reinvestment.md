5 │ Reinvesting $20 k MRR — a 12-month roadmap
Bucket	% of revenue	$/month	Rationale & triggers
Core ops & tooling	15 %	$3 k	Perforce/GitHub, cloud build farm, Airtable, QuickBooks, marketing SaaS
Contract production labour	25 %	$5 k	1 part-time senior programmer + rotating art/QA hours
Deep LiveOps & content drops	15 %	$3 k	Monthly event art, balance pass, server capacity
User acquisition / marketing	20 %	$4 k	Ad spend, creator sponsorships. Indie benchmarks suggest 25–50 % of budget for marketing

R&D / new prototypes	10 %	$2 k	Two-week “vertical slice” every quarter
Cash buffer / runway	10 %	$2 k	Builds a 6-month reserve in ~30 months
Founders stipend (optional)	5 %	$1 k	Only if absolutely needed; otherwise roll into buffer

After fixed SaaS and part-time talent, you still have $7–8 k discretionary: enough to scale paid ads when a title spikes, or to onboard another contractor for a busy sprint. Revisit the split quarterly—if LiveOps ROI > ads, shift spend accordingly.
