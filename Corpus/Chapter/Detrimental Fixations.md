# Detrimental Fixations

## being fixated and interested in only a specific set of problems will limit you greatly and reduce your level of satisfaction in your career

## being a general problem-solver who cares less about what problems they solve but just the process of prolem-solving itself will have a more rewarding career

## focusing on your attribute and performance goals makes you more process-oriented and therefore allows you to solve a wider variety of problems.
