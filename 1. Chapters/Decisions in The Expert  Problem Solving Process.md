## Figure 1 - Problem-solving Decisions by Categories

*Blue arrows represent more realistic iteration paths of operations. Numbers indicate number of decisions in category. Knowledge and skill development were mentioned themes but are not decisions.*

---

## Category A. Selection and Goals of the Problem

This category involves deciding on the importance of the problem, what criteria a solution must meet, and how well it matches the capabilities, resources, and priorities of the expert. As an example, an earth scientist described the goal of her project (decision 3, goals, criteria, constraints?) to map and date the earliest volcanic rocks associated with what is now Yellowstone and explained why the project was a good fit for her group (2, opportunity fits solver’s expertise?) and her decision to pursue the project in light of the significance of this type of eruption in major extinction events (1, what is important in field?). In many cases, decisions related to framing (see category B) were mentioned before decisions in this category or were an integral part of the process for developing goals.

**Decisions in this category are:**

1. **What is important in the field?**

   * What are important questions or problems? Where is the field heading? Are there advances in the field that open new possibilities?

2. **Opportunity fits solver's expertise?**

   * If and where are there gaps/opportunities to solve in field? Given experts’ unique perspectives and capabilities, are there opportunities particularly accessible to them? (This could involve challenging the status quo, questioning assumptions in the field.)

3. **Goals, criteria, constraints?**

   * What are the goals for this problem? Possible considerations include:
     a. What are the goals, design criteria, or requirements of the problem or its solution?
     b. What is the scope of the problem?
     c. What constraints are there on the solution?
     d. What will be the criteria on which the solution is evaluated?

## Category B. Frame Problem

These decisions lead to a more concrete formulation of the solution process and potential solutions. This involves identifying the key features of the problem and deciding on predictive frameworks to use (see “Predictive Framework” section below), as well as narrowing down the problem, often forming specific questions or hypotheses. Many of these decisions are guided by past problem solutions with which the expert is familiar and sees as relevant.

**Decisions in this category are:**

4. **Important features and info?**

   * What are the important underlying features or concepts that apply? Could include:
     a. Which available information is relevant to problem solving and why?
     b. (When appropriate) Create/find a suitable abstract representation of core ideas and information.

5. **What predictive framework?**

   * Which potential predictive frameworks to use? (Decide among possible predictive frameworks or create framework.)

6. **How to narrow down the problem?**

   * How to narrow down the problem? Often involves formulating specific questions and hypotheses.

7. **Related problems?**

   * What are related problems or work seen before, and what aspects of their problem-solving process and solutions might be useful in the present context?

8. **Potential solutions?**

   * What are potential solutions? (This is based on experience and fitting some criteria for solution they have for a problem having general key features identified.)

9. **Is problem solvable?**

   * Is the problem plausibly solvable and is the solution worth pursuing given the difficulties, constraints, risks, and uncertainties?

## Category C. Plan the Process for Solving

These decisions establish the specifics needed to solve the problem and include: how to simplify the problem and decompose it into pieces, what specific information is needed, how to obtain that information, and what are the resources needed and priorities?

**Decisions in this category are:**

10. **Approximations and simplifications to make?**
11. **How to decompose into subproblems?**
12. **Most difficult or uncertain areas?**
13. **What info needed?**
14. **Priorities?**
15. **Specific plan for getting information?**

---

## Category D. Interpret Information and Choose Solution(s)

This category includes deciding how to analyze, organize, and draw conclusions from available information, reacting to unexpected information, and deciding upon a solution.

**Decisions in this category are:**

16. **Which calculations and data analysis?**
17. **How to represent and organize information?**
18. **How believable is the information?**
19. **How does information compare to predictions?**
20. **Any significant anomalies?**
21. **Appropriate conclusions?**
22. **What is the best solution?**

---

## Category E. Reflect

Reflection decisions occur throughout the process and include deciding whether assumptions are justified, whether additional knowledge or information is needed, how well the solution approach is working, and whether potential and then final solutions are adequate.

**Decisions in this category are:**

23. **Assumptions and simplifications appropriate?**
24. **Additional knowledge needed?**
25. **How well is the problem-solving approach working?**
26. **How good is the solution?**

---

## Category F. Implications and Communication of Results

These are decisions about the broader implications of the work, and how to communicate results most effectively.

**Decisions in this category are:**

27. **Broader implications?**
28. **Audience for communication?**
29. **Best way to present work?**

---

## Category G. Ongoing Skill and Knowledge Development

Although we focused on decisions in the problem-solving process, the experts volunteered general skills and knowledge they saw as important elements of problem-solving expertise in their fields.

**Non-decision themes in this category are:**

30. **Stay up to date in field**
31. **Intuition and experience**
32. **Interpersonal, teamwork**
33. **Efficiency**
34. **Attitude**
