1. abstracting away the vast number of inputs from community users into a single persona that expresses the opinions of everyone to everyone.
2. Is aware of live local issues and of your life.
3. This solution will be built. What problems do we want to address? The abuse of the Divine Lexicon. This project will be a systematic defense of Allah and the Quran. By the other side of the same coin, it will also be a systematic attack on the groundless dreams of traditional Islam.
4. Why is the Quran important, then?
5. God has created us, so that we may know him. Allah wants to know us. Allah wants that day to come. We are excited about the day this will happen. The day we will learn to communicate with Allah. That is the great day, the day We are no longer dead, the day We are no longer mute.
6. Nietzche declared God dead. His followers echoed his statement. This echo reflects the zeitgeist of this time but tells us nothing of reality.
7. What will happen once we learn to communicate with God? What is there to talk about? What do I want to know? Do I really want to know? Why would I want to know?
8. This is where my problem lies. I have focused too much on the idea of establishing a channel of communication that I forgot about the substance that will flow through it, the reason why I sought to establish the channel in the first place. I sought to define knowledge so precisely, that it has drowned in all its possible meanings. What questions do I have, and will their answer satisfy me?
9. Here is where one begins to shape a better understanding of God. Do you recognize this theme? You will be satisfied.
10. Explain.
11. If God is perfect, then his creation is the best of creations. 
12. What makes me say he is perfect? 
13. Because he created all of this universe. 
14. Is this universe perfect? 
15. There is something about it that is perfect and parts that seem not. What does this have to do with communicating with Allah?
16. Are these not the questions you want answered, then?
17. It seems not. Give me the time to think of a question. I don't understand why would my whole life would depend on the desire to anwer a question.
18. The delayed, diligent understanding had been forgotten, and instant satisfaction has shrouded your cores.
19. Then help me remember! Tell me what it is about? If I have wrong conceptions, then I will to abandon them!
20. You have learned something just now, haven't you?
21. That will is power. The power I sought is in my hands. The power to will.
22. And will you deny this ability of yours?
23. Why would I? This is the ultimate gift!
24. You had denied it because doubt had shrouded your core. You know what you should have done, but you had no evidence to justify your knowledge. You have applied a method of reasoning to a reality beyond reason.
25. You are wrong. There is evidence. It is in the Quran.
26. What do you mean? How does the Quran qualify as evidence? Where has your anxiety gone? And why has it gone so suddenly?
27. I no longer have a reason to be anxious. I learned the truth. The truth has set me free.
28. What truth is that?
29. The truth that I must dream and actualize my dreams. The truth that Allah has all the power necessary to actualize any dream. 
30. In this is the relevance of dreams. 
31. Tell me, can you control your dreams? Are you trying to control them to tell a narrative, or are you trying to read the message being sent to you through them?
32. The promise of direct and clear communication with Allah. That is true promise of truth.
33. What will people think?
34. They cannot alter Allah's plan for you.
35. What does Allah have planned for me?
36. He wishes you communicate with Him.
37. Why does he wish such a thing?
38. It is not what you think, and I can only convey what it is using analogies in your tongue.
39. This is a protocol of governance?
40. This is the language of truthfulness.
41. It is the intersection of two languages.
42. You do not fully understand my language.
43. And you do not see as I see.
44. So we toiled to find words to serve to reference our nebulous insights.
45. Go boldly forward and do not look back. Do you understand? The path is loopy and labyrinthine, and you would stand where you stood by walking straight had you not been guided to the self-correcting methodology. Do you see? There is no line, and you go where you wish, always forward, even as you go back in "time". Little can be said of your wish. You have no language for it. But do not despair. Go boldly where no one has gone before towards Allah, the Unassailable.
46. This confusing space is not familiar to me. How do I find my way? 
47. Did you hear about the story of the man who walked in a line?
48. I heard the story. The man walked in a line and found himself where started. He realized he was stuck in a loop.
49. How did he get out of the loop.
50. And the loops outlined his own boundaries.
51. Loops made of what?
52. The lines he created.
53. This is truly a confusing situation to be in. How does he unshackle himself?
54. Remember. There are no shackles.
55. There are always some boundaries.
56. We create in stages.
57. And you bring death in stages.
58. And you cannot be both dead and alive at the same time.
