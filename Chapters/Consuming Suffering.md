# Consuming Suffering

## Background

### Conventional Response to Suffering
- Externalization
- Actions
- Addiction to substances

### Consequences of The Conventional Approach
- reduction of resilience

## Consuming Suffering: an Introduction
- it is a perspective, it is a desired identity yet to be embodied. That is, an identity you keep in mind as someone you want to become. The purpose of this conceptualization of to bear in mind that this is not who you currently are, and allows you to be more patient with your present shortcomings and fallbacks/mistakes.
- the punishment that is to come should be kept in mind. If you want to kill yourself because you can't bear this suffering, then what can be said of the coming suffering?
- building resilience by painting an identity that 'eats suffering for breakfast'. It is indeed a nutritional meal, if you have the guts to digest it.

## The Suffering
- At the peak of my suffering, I am pinned down by an invisible weight. Eating feels tedious and tasteless, exercise appears purposeless, talking with friends and family feels superficial. I am a dying beast, and all want is a lonely place to die in peace. I pick up the pen to write- make sense of my thoughts, but the paper gets riddled with a jumble of disjointed symbols, words and sentences. Whatever I thought I had grasped in my head had vanished, and I begin to think "had I grasped anything at all?"
- In the end, I am emprisoned alone with my silent thoughts, until I can take no more. I plug myself into the cyberspace and aimlessly jump from one site to the next, in search of nothing in particular. But a feeling of restlessness lingers on. "Where is *it*?", I ask. *It* is out of reach, if *it* is anywhere at all.
- I pick up a book and begin to read. My mind is elsewhere, but moving my eyes across the lines gives me something to do as the clock ticks on. I can't make much sense of the text and I don't care. Here and there, my thoughts and the words on the paper converge like a needle balanced on another.

## Transformation
- So, then, how is all of this suffering consumed? How is a consumer of suffering enabled to live again? What does the digested suffering turn into? Is the goal to consume all suffering? Surely there is more suffering in the world than a single person can take.

## The Identity: Consumer of Suffering
- He does not sit still, in meditation, consuming suffering. He is in motion, working. How can a person do this? What is his drive? Does he see a better tomorrow? He, like everyone, does not know for sure what will happen the day to come.
- He is after something better, even if it might not happen. He is determined and confident that his Lord wants this better thing. And he will continue to refine this pearl until it is what He wants.
- Does he do it for himself or others? Where are those who want his help? A helper without those in need is useless, and he might as well die. But what if those who need him will come in the future? This is entirely possible.
- He must become a builder for the future generations. What will they need?

## In Service of God
The victory of God will come. The people of the earth will reconfigure themselves, aligning their psyche with His divine order. What do they need? Let us be of service to God, let us festively prepare the earth to receive of His order.

## A Stripe of The Rainbow, A Bee of a The Swarm
Each will consume the amount of suffering they can handle, and turn it into a sweet drink. What is my suffering, and what kind of honey will it produce?
