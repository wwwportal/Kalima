## Example session

### 2025-11-14 – Ibrahim’s dua for a secure city

- **Time window:** 22:10–22:45
- **Primary focus:**
  - Compare the dua formulations in 14:35 and 2:126 focusing on structure and lexical variation.

- **Ayat analyzed (primary):**
  - 14:35
  - 2:126

- **New annotations added:**
  - Count: 2
  - Types: stylistic, comparative
  - Example IDs: a-2025-11-14-0001, a-2025-11-14-0002

- **Key observations:**
  - Both verses share the frame “وإذ قال إبراهيم رب اجعل هذا…” indicating a stable supplication template.
  - Variation in “الْبَلَدَ” vs “بَلَدًا” may align with different discourse settings (established vs potential/abstract city).
  - The vocative “رَبِّ” directly precedes the operative verb “اجعل”, marking a compact dua pattern.

- **Questions opened:**
  - Does Ibrahim consistently use “رَبِّ” before major petitions across all his speech acts?
  - Are there cases where the request precedes explicit mention of the addressee?

- **Links to detailed notes:**
  - [[thematic/ibrahim-style]]

- **Next actions (for future sessions):**
  - [ ] Use `views/roots` for root "ج ع ل" to list all occurrences involving creative/transformative acts.
  - [ ] Add new annotations tagging all Ibrahim speech acts with `tags: ["ibrahim", "direct-speech"]`.
