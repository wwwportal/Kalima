Why hasn't he allowed himself to fully grasp the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence? He thinks it is because AI has been getting too much airtime on mainstream media, causing him to be suspicious of the true purpose of AI. What will it help us do? He had questions about the mind, I wanted to understand biology. I also had questions about the world, so I wanted to learn physics. But now, why have we come to computers? This is the part that he was still uncertain about. He remembered then when he was exploring esotericism, and learned about the relationship between mathematics and the universe, then the relationship between mathematics and language. Language led to math, logic, formal languages, programming languages, and now finally where we are, at a potential convergence point, where formal languages and natural languages might be unified in a single system.

Times have changed. My mission has evolved. I am no longer seeking the object of my devotion, per se, but rather now actively working towards and with God. How can I use my constraints to achieve this goal? Getting closer to God... is to learn to communicate with God. This is why I was originally so focused on trying to decipher language, taking the approach of uncovering the obscured points of the world.
