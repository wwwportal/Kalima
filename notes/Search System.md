### 1.1. Surah Search

Type the number of the surah to list all its ayat.

### 1.2. Ayah Search

Type the number the surah and ayah, separated by a colon. For example, if I want to display the first ayah of surah Ya-Seen, then I will type "36:1" into the command prompt, and the ayah in Arabic should show up almost instantly. No translations are included by default, but the Dr.Hany interpretation should be available soon.

### 1.3. Syntactic Pattern Search

Type

### 1.4. Morphological Pattern Search

### 1.5. Root Word Search

In order to search the ayat in the Quran where a specific root appears, type:

root [radical1] [radical2] [radical3], where each radical represents a letter from the root, and where the roots are defined using transliterations, in the following way:

- ا = alif
- ب = baa
- ت = taa
- ث = tha
- ج = jym
- ح = haa
- خ = kha
- د = dal
- ذ = dhal
- ر = [incomplete in original]

### 1.6. Phonological Pattern Search

Some words in the Quran sound similar but are spelled differently. It would be useful if we could identify these similar-sounding words with different orthographies.

### 1.7. Stylistic Pattern Search

You only define a word once, and whenever you ask for the meaning of an ayah, it shows the definition of that word in all ayat in which the word appears, and shows the other undefined words as blank boxes, or shows them in arabic.

For example, if I define bismi in ayah 1:1, as 'in the symbolism of', then I ask for the meaning for that ayah, then it shows something like:

[in the symbolism of] [allah] [ar-rahman] [ar-raheem]

Or

[in the symbolism of] [???] [???] [???]

And if you search any ayah that has the word bismi, then it will show that word as [in the symbolism of] and all the other undefined words as [???]
