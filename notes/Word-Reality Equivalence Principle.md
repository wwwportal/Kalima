He felt a sudden grip in his heart when he imagined an interaction with others and realized he didn’t even know how to act within his imagination. He felt like he was watching a movie and he was trying to reach into the TV, which he "knew" was impossible. As though we was behind a black mirror and he could see them but they could not. The scene was only in his mind, yet it unsettled him as if it were real.

“If only I could speak to them,” he thought. “If only I could tell *do* something.”

It was strange how divided he was within himself. His rational side dismissed the imagined as unreal, mere noise of thought. But another part of him—she—moved differently. She treated imagination as presence, not fiction. She gathered her attention as if the images before her eyes and the sounds around her ears had simply shifted form. When she encountered a scene within, she didn’t stare at it idly. She leapt toward it, answered it, closed the loop between vision and self. In her world, imagination was a conversation, not an illusion.

He feared what might happen in the future. She recognized that what he saw in fear was already here: not a forecast but a state of being. To imagine was to participate, to become what one saw.

This insight reaches further. What she understood of imagination, he would one day understand of prayer. The right duʿāʾ shapes the right reality. A prayer sincerely composed and spoken with intention becomes a seed that unfolds almost immediately in the field of events.

In the Qurʾān App, this means the most important thing to watch for is the harmony between an uttered duʿāʾ and the meanings revealed in daily life. When the system keeps track of both—the prayers made and the moments that follow—it begins to illuminate the hidden correspondences between them. The user’s reflections, recorded beside their supplications, reveal how intention and outcome converge, how the unseen speaks back through experience.

Between thought and event lies the imaginal: the living bridge where prayer takes form, where what is spoken in sincerity becomes what is lived in truth.

## Breath 

The Quran research app embodies the rhythm of the **nafs**—the self that breathes, learns, and releases. It treats study as a living cycle of **inhale and exhale**: the inhalation of tension and grasping that marks a temporary _movement away from Allah_, a forgetfulness born of striving; and the exhalation that softens, remembers, and returns to alignment with the Truth. Instead of endless accumulation, it restores balance: each interaction with the text mirrors the natural alternation between analysis and surrender, intellect and stillness. By grounding interpretation in this breathing rhythm, the app becomes not only a tool for linguistic exploration but also a mirror for the user’s inner state—guiding them from contraction back to remembrance, toward a more integrated and embodied understanding of the Qur’an.

## Situational Awareness
When he looked inward, he saw himself poised on a tightrope—past behind him, future ahead. He realized that to truly live, he must find balance among all three: past, present, and future. To do so, he had to know how he spent his awareness throughout time and who he might become—so clearly that he could speak to his past and future self.

There are many pasts and many futures and I don't mean it poetically. Rather epistemically.
