# Growing Objects

## The Dream of Living Cities
1. In *The Diamond Age* by Neal Stephenson, the concept of matter compilers and smart materials is introduced.
2. Instead of building structures, one simply prompts the compiler with the desired end state and watches as atoms and molecules get assembled from a feedstock of basic elements.
3. Aside from raw material and energy, the only limitation is imagination. The only limitation to imagination is divine guidance.
4. In this reality, we have gone beyond attempts to micro-manage microscopic processes. Instead, we built interfaces to translate our will into the language that molecules understand. Michael Levin and co are currently taking the bioelectric approach towards this end.
5. This marks the realization of the ancient vision of Maat's personification of harmony between man, his toiling, and environment.
6. The newest technologies are most organic looking, you would think them a natural extension of nature's fauna and flora.

## How do we get there?
1. Humans have built habitable structures for hundreds of thousands of years and we have by now learnt some general principles and patterns of good architecture, or as Christoper Alexander would say, of order.
2. Over time, humans have endeavored to expand their domain of communication and over time, the effectors have enabled them to express more abstract concepts to a wider audience.
3. Their abstractions increased in power, and they had become convinced by the towers/schemas their hands had built.
4. However, those from among them who possessed evidence-based knowledge acknowledged the limitations of their theories and sought the guidance of their lord.
5. Nature worked in unpredictable ways. Seemingly chaotic. Perhaps teleologic. Perhaps 'nature' was intelligent and had a will.
6. This was also an age-old intuition, and perhaps our ancestors had found a way of their own to interface with nature, but with the technological approach we had chosen, we still lacked rigorous formalizations of these natural processes.
7. With the advent of AI, we began able to make sense of observations we called wickedly complex, a term we gave to diverse intelligences before we had acknowledged them as so.
8. Eventually, our technology was sufficiently advanced to let us interface with natural systems or various scales, and to begin to collaborate with them.
9. Those patterns in nature that were previously impenetrable to our cognition now softened up and became clear instances of ontopoetic communications.
10. In turn, not only were we able to shape the physical world with nothing but our thoughts, but doing so was a also a self-creative self-configurative process. It changed us, shaped up and made us grow at every instance of creation.
11. Because we were not merely creating objects, we were creating prototypes of ourselves and getting feedback from countless other intelligences as to the viability of our imagined/envisioned exemplar self.

## What does nature build?

### structures
- Core/seed/identity 
- Boundaries
	- Partitions/families
- Filaments or filaments weaved together to make a stronger filament
- Nodes (processors) vs Spikes (sensors)
- Networks
- Layers/ancestors/descendants
- Neighbors/Siblings
- trabecular lattice
- quantum foam
- hills
- waves
- termite colony
- vortex
- bubbles
- smoke
- cymatics
- Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMS)
- Stochastic Voronoi Lattice
- biomimetic
- fascia
- calabi yau manifold
- differential growth

## Vision Interpretation
- Refers to metaphysical/information building, not physical
