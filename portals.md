Mental motion can be described as going from one topic to the next. Familiarity with a topic enables the user to reach the topic with less effort without much traveling whereas unknown topics require some strange process of navigation to find. Spending a few hours vivifying an unfamiliar concept or set of concepts can create a portal to that space, making recall of the space almost immediate the next time you seek to visit it. Abandonned and rarely frequented places become further away from you, until they become unknown.
