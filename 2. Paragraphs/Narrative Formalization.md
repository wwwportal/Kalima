Using which language can I demonstrate that an interpretation mapped onto a symbol/word/object/phenomena is true?

Can the interpretation be true from one perspective and false from another?

How can I formulate perspective such that a set of perspectives can be evaluatively compared and contrasted?

Based on what criteria can we determine the truthfulness of a perspective? What about its truthness?
