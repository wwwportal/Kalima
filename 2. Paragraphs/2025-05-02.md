- 1817 : The nodes program needs some adjustements. Links were created using the index number but using node names might be more user-friendly. I was not sure whether I should do this was the right decision or not though and I ended up losing time being undecisive, but not entirely without reason. Names can be a bit tricky to work with, but the challenges they come with are not beyond my current skill level. Spaces in the name of nodes with more than one word need to be accounted for, as does the capitalization of said words. Given the complexity of the program is increasing, I feel it is appropriate to create a list of the tasks related to this project.
