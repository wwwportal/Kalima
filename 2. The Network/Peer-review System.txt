the peer-review system: I know that a peer-review system can quickly become one-sided once an authority has been put in place, one that is difficult to question. I wish to solve this issue by labeling contributions according to Quranic principles. Say someone proposes an interpretation or supplication. Someone else would review it. They are not allowed to say just anything, but are supposed to support or refute the contribution based on Quranic principles. You can think of these principles as moves, just like you’d have in a video game. The player can attack or defend the contribution using a limited number of moves. How does the global brain fit into this project? That’s basically where the multiplayer side of things come into play. So I need to spend more time thinking about how the multiplayer system will work.
