# Focus on The Individual: a return to the self

1. Which aspect of the self should I focus on?
2. The part of the self that is responsible for deciding what is right and wrong? The part that decides which dreams to puruse?
3. By which criteria do you decide what is important in your life?
4. How to align your behavior with your life priorities?
5. How to keep your dream alive?
6. Which dreams are worth pursuing?
7. Who are your role models?
8. Is your goal within the realm of what you can control?
9. Character analysis as a path to self-correction: by analyzing characters from novels and stories objectively, you learn to see those parts of yourself objectively. You can then ask critical questions about that character, engaging in a live dialog with it, trying to correct yourself by finding/developing a more defensible character.
10. Don't create a system whose usefulness only becomes apparent once many people use it. Instead, create a system who is useful even to a single user, and this benefit only gets amplified as the number of users increase.
11. Think globally, act locally: how will my actions today, towards the people around me, move me towards the goal of global harmony?
