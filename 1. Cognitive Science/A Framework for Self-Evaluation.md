# A Framework for Self-Evaluation

1. Make a list of attributes that the ideal self has
3. Truthfully grade yourself on these attributes, using evidence from your personal experiences
4. 2. Sort the attributes by level of importance/priority based on determined criteria. You could sort the attributes based on which you are most lacking in.
