# Thought Architecture

There is a way to process information insightfully, but the structure of the process is not straightforward nor linear. It is not structured per-say. Every 'insightful train of thought' is different. However, the core elements remain the same, no matter the order in which they are employed. This makes it more of an art than a science, but it's incredible reproducibility gives it the rigour the qualify it as scientific.

There are quite a lot of elements to this process, and so attempting to apply many of them at the same time without mastering any of them can lead to the poor application of any of the elements, and ultimately leads to confusion.

Here's our challenge. If the process is so flexible, then how can we represent is linguistically for the purpose of analysis and communication? Notice a potentially false assumption that the process needs to or can be linguistically represented. We will continue with this plausible assumption while actively seeking to falsify it.

Another assumption that we might be better off doing away with from the beginning is the active role of earthlings in the process of insightful perception of reality and objects throughout it. We are becoming increasingly confident in the role of malaikah in this process, and thus it is slowly being unveiled to us as a sacred process. The need for religion becomes obvious.

The process of insightful perception can thus be recoined as the process of effective inter-layer communication (as in layers of the samawaat).

I suppose one of the first and most important elements to begin with is the intention behind the communication. It has been said numerous times before that the purpose is to "communicate with Allahh", but only recently has the meaning of this begun to unravel. Allahh, our Allahh, is the lord of al-3aalameen.
