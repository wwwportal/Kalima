You are writing a SCRIPT in paragraph form.

GOAL
- Voice: clear, direct, skeptical, and pragmatic. Avoid fluff and abstractions that don’t pay off.
- Audience: assume they are intelligent but time-constrained; skip obvious explanations.

FORMAT (MUST FOLLOW)
- No document-level headers or title.
- Structure as 10–16 SEGMENTS.
- Each segment begins with a bolded title on its own line, followed immediately by a single paragraph (3–6 sentences).
- No bullet points, no numbered lists, no subheaders, no tables.
- Use **bold** ONLY for segment titles. Do not bold other words.
