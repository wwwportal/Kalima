## Cedeing to the future rasool
islam, the cedeing as a deen (debt) for you. Why do they have a debt? What do they have to pay for? The followers of the torah, before the expiration of the Torah.
In the afterlife the nabiyeen are tasked with ceding their authority

ibrahim's 3 tasks
1. bring forth scripture and supporting muhammad
2. help preserver it. It will take a long time for humans to be able to.
3. cede to the final rasool (and prove that the future rasool is coming)
4. then eventually passes to the afterlife and finishes his 3iddah to get out of hissab.

to prove that give away what is not ours in the first place. you are truthful in your submission to Allah.

ibrahim has an arc. multiple episodes about his life. the arc oof ibrahim starts eary in his life as an earthling and way way after his death.

ibrahim has to cede to a future rasool. THe scripture is not enough. WHy not? How could he cede to something he was involved in making? something of his? hm?

if ibrahim gets tricked into believing someone is (wrongly) the future rasool, then his 3iddah will increase. This is what happened in the story of yusuf, he ceded to him.

THis caused the problem of phir3aoun: religion under the state.

the torah/system of prophethood is known as a "detour"/3iwaj. it was not necessary. So ibrahim created the problem of yusuf.

6:79 : i have oritented my look towards the final scripture.? 
12:94 : the glad tiding. passive participle.the active possessor of the glad tiding.

12:96 - when the basheer will have come

2:213 - the hudah of allah is the guidance?

guidance from Allah not from ibrahim's rabb( his own rationality).

is part of ceding to accept things you don't have evidence for? there is some informaiton you begin to see in the quran, some pattern, and the pattern itself is self-evidence.
