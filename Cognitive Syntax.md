 A resulting insight from my past years of research have led me to understand that reading, and the mastery of language in general, are essential for precise and deep thought. Aside from vocabulary, which we all know is important to think precisely, (as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis says, your ability to think about things depends on your language of those things), syntax is absolutely essential, for it determines the structure of your thoughts.

Some of you may remember that Dr.Hany said: the real purpose of our physical existence, within the physical universe, is to acquire language and vocabulary, which we humans can abstract "3ibra" into conceptual metaphorical constructs, which are the building blocks of the communication of all developing Anfus.

Chris Langan argues "the Human Cognitive Syntax (HCS) (or Human Cognitive-Perceptual Syntax) is the set of structural and functional rules obeyed by the human mind." and "Since humans are real, human cognition is embedded in the generalized cognition of reality. At the same time, for us to be able to cognitively refer to reality, it must conform to our cognitive categories (i.e., to the HCS). Hence there is an isomorphism [structrual equivalence, or a 1:1 mapping] between human cognition and generalized cognition, and this implies that they are mutually consistent aspects of a single global form of cognition, namely SCSPL (Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language)."

In simple terms, the universe itself has certain cognitive syntax rules by which it processes information within itself and by which it configures (or evolves) itself. This is roughly equivalent to the concept of Mulk in the quran, which is less about control and moreso the set of rules and standards of operation. Through the Quran we gain additional insights about this:

At-Talaq 65:12

ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَٰوَٰتٍ وَمِنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ يَتَنَزَّلُ ٱلْأَمْرُ بَيْنَهُنَّ لِتَعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَدْ أَحَاطَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عِلْمًۢا

Allah did not say he created us to know the universe, but he created the universe that we may acquire knowledge of certain rules of operation of Allah. This necessitates that not only the universe is compatible with out cognitive syntax, but that our cognitive syntax is developed through engagement with the universe, and in particular, the Quran (Since it is more easily processed by our minds, and thereby enables us to process more complex realities in the outter world, whose language we may not be very familiar with).

What I understood from all this is that the universe itself is a language that we humans have used to develop our human language. Ibrahim was granted his Lisaanan Sidqin, a locution of truthfulness which is transferable across multiple languages, and upon which the Quran's language is founded and developed.

Grammar (especially Quranic grammar) is thus an instrument for unraveling meaning, and increasing our connection to Allah, which gives us more power to navigate the various realms of the universe. Mathematics is a language, and some say it is the language of the universe but human language is more expressive, nuanced, multilayered, and therefore closer to the structure (or compositional style) of the universe itself, by which we self-process (contemplate) and self-configure (make decisions that change who we are).

Side note: human language is not without Mathematics, it includes and transcends it.
