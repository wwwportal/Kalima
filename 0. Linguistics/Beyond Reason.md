# Beyond Reason

## A Short History of Reason and Its Accomplishments

## The Limits of Reason

## Cedeing to the future rasool
islam, the cedeing as a deen (debt) for you. Why do they have a debt? What do they have to pay for? The followers of the torah, before the expiration of the Torah.
In the afterlife the nabiyeen are tasked with ceding their authority

ibrahim's 3 tasks
1. bring forth scripture and supporting muhammad
2. help preserver it. It will take a long time for humans to be able to.
3. cede to the final rasool (and prove that the future rasool is coming)
4. then eventually passes to the afterlife and finishes his 3iddah to get out of hissab.

to prove that give away what is not ours in the first place. you are truthful in your submission to Allah.

ibrahim has an arc. multiple episodes about his life. the arc oof ibrahim starts eary in his life as an earthling and way way after his death.

ibrahim has to cede to a future rasool. THe scripture is not enough. WHy not? How could he cede to something he was involved in making? something of his? hm?

if ibrahim gets tricked into believing someone is (wrongly) the future rasool, then his 3iddah will increase. This is what happened in the story of yusuf, he ceded to him.

THis caused the problem of phir3aoun: religion under the state.

the torah/system of prophethood is known as a "detour"/3iwaj. it was not necessary. So ibrahim created the problem of yusuf.

6:79 : i have oritented my look towards the final scripture.?
12:94 : the glad tiding. passive participle.the active possessor of the glad tiding.

12:96 - when the basheer will have come

2:213 - the hudah of allah is the guidance?

guidance from Allah not from ibrahim's rabb( his own rationality).

is part of ceding to accept things you don't have evidence for? there is some informaiton you begin to see in the quran, some pattern, and the pattern itself is self-evidence.
===========================================================================

First, apologies for not commenting despite your multiple requests to the audience to do so.

I haven't been at my best mentally, so I can't say I have fully grasped all the concepts. Regardless, some clouds of potential rain have formed in my mind regarding the substantial speech you have been delivering recently.

It is as though all the stories and concepts are converging into a single point of focus. As we climb layers of abstraction, the grape vines have climbed over the garden walls and connected the long separated enclosures.

The story of Ibrahim is one I deeply relate to. Though I can't claim to be as skillful as he might have been, I know I am overly reliant on my own Reason. As a master, it promises more than it can deliver. But beyond it is a place too strange.

 It is still difficult for me to trust the other side. Here appears one of my questions: you say "rationality and scripture", but isn't rationality applied to the scripture? Aren't all the tools of extracting evidence essentially tools of logic? I know we have moved away from this purely rational approach, on to a finer sense, such as the kind that was needed to ready one's cognition to perceive the unspoken fact in the first layer of the story of Yussuf. In retrospect, such facts fit seamlessly, and mr.Reason will not complain. I'm not really sure at which point the scripture goes beyond reason. You did say it has to do with things that cannot be perceived. But isn't it strange that some people have seemingly reasoned their way to similar ideas of a stratified network of conscious identities? Albeit without all the details. We can say they did not do so using reason, but presented in ways to appeal to reason. I am fully aware you did not say to do away with reason. But I'm not sure I understand what you think of as the limits of reason. You mentioned what can be sensed. So, then is empirical knowledge the limit of reason? If not, and it extends to abstract knowledge, then I'm not sure I understand the difference between reason and knowledge received through some kind of inter-layer anfus collboration. 

is there a point where knowledge beyond reason cannot be justified, and if so, then what becomes of belief with justification as opposed to blind belief?

## The Three Limitations of Reason
1. does not tell you how to connect with allah: the specific rituals or acts of devotion
2. Ghayb: knowledge of the future
3. Knowledge of the afterlife: baqarah: ibrahim asks show me how you revive the death: allah showed him to how use the dua

## What Ibrahim Needs to do to Get Out of Hissab
1. ceding to the delta in the scripture?
2. not just to make an argument that had I been given the scripture I would have ceded to you
3. cede to whom? 
4. When given rational thinking and scripture, did he know everything in the scripture? He was not the composer of everything in the Quran. So he does not know everything in the scripture. What does this imply?
   1. "did you receive the story of so and so" ayaat in the Quran: means they were not all sitting together in a committee when composing the Quran.
   2. To whom is the responsability of presenting the Quran? the future rasool. He ceded to the knowledge broadcast by the future rasool. And all nabiyoon have to do this. They all have a delta they're not aware of.
