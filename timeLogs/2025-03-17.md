- 1100 👨‍🎓 I have about 8 hours before the lab. I could spend 2 hours on OS, 2 hours on Networking and 2 hours for programming, leaving me 2 extra hours to do what I want. Interleave the topics each hour.
- 1058 👨‍🎓 If you have the time, spend some time reviewing exception handling in java as part of your lab 5 preparations.
- 1053 👨‍🎓 Got to college and started studying. I need to do the pre-lab 5 for OOP. At the moment, I'm reading the OS notes. I also want to finish reading last week's Network Programming notes.
