- 10:16 PM 💡 I could look forward to cooking a meal every weekend or spend 30 minutes each day working on a personal passion project. Be more mindful during your breaks.
- 10:06 PM 🤩 I realized I need something to look forward to every day if I want to get better emotionally. What could that be? Sheilla shared with me that she looks forward to the simple things in her life: a good night's sleep, good food and good conversations with good friends. I like her approach, but will that work for me? I wonder what I could look forward to.
- 10:04 PM 😪 I just got home from the college. I skipped object oriented programming and missed my calculus class because I was too focused in the final report draft. At least I made some progress on the report. I still need to find better sources for the points I drafted though.
- 6:26 PM 💪 I grabbed a coffee and worked out for a couple dozen minutes. I'm not ready to start working on my part of the draft consultation meeting preprations. I need to write the 'impact of the problem' section, which requires a fair amount of research. I need to look for the impact that the lack of effective tools for choosing open source software has had in the past.
- 5:18 PM 🌝 Soon I will begin working on my part of the final report draft. There will be a fair amount of reading. I'm going to wash my face, buy a coffee and take a walk before starting.
- 4:50 PM 😄 I successfully completed the Network Programming post-lab 9 quiz. It feels good. I'm happy about it. I also finished the OOP hybrid quiz about files, which informed me that I should spend some time reviewing the concepts related to files in java. I'm about to do the network programming Module 12 quiz.
- 4:47 PM 😄 I'm looking forward to going home and eating good food. For now, however, I must work.
- 4:37 PM ☺️ You don't have to smile, and that doesn't mean you're not happy. You can frown, and that doesn't mean you're angry. You can cry, and that doesn't mean you're hopeless.
- 4:24 PM 🧘 It's okay to be confused and make mistakes. I know how to learn from my mistakes and how to dispel confusion. To do that, I must first have the right attitude. A growth mindset.
- 4:19 PM 🤔 It's okay to be alone, but your emotions have to be managed properly. Don't allow your loneliness to make you sad. Focus on what's important. What's important is that you do well today. Today, I will do well if I stay positive and productive, and I will stay productive if I stay positive, so let's keep it that way.
- 4:15 PM ☺️ I just finished the Network Programming lab. It was a bit stressful. Many were having issues capturing and finding the right frames; the three for the three way handshake and the four for connection termination. I'm going to do the programming quiz and the post-lab quiz, and get started working on my appointed portion of the final report draft.
- 9:46 AM ☺️ Take it easy. If you work too hard then you'll burnout quickly and won't have the energy to maintain productivity levels. Relax your muscles and be mindful of your breathing.
- 9:42 AM 🫀 I'm happy. There's no reason not to be. I may have a lot of shortcomings but I'm learning a lot. I'm going at my own pace. I may be undisciplined at times but honestly I'm much more disciplined than I was before, and I don't see that trend changing anytime soon.
- 9:36 AM 💡 I was trying to find a job in which I wouldn't have to think about branding, marketing and management. I think network programming might be exactly what I was looking for. I always think about networks anyways, but I was turned off by the field by the misconception that my job would only be to manage the network using an application, but there are jobs that focus on the programming aspect of it and I think that layer of abstraction might be perfect for me.
- 9:28 AM 👨‍🎓 Feeling great now. Lots of energy - Alhamdulilah - and I'm preparing for the Network Programming lab.
- 8:59 AM 😫 A bit tired. I have energy but emotionally there's a void I can't seem to be able to fill. Maybe it's okay to feel lonely. I'll get over it. I just need to get busy working. I have a Network Programming lab today at 12, so I'll spend some time preparing for that. I also need to spend time working on the final report draft. There's gonna be a fair amount of reading so I should get started on that as soon as possible.
