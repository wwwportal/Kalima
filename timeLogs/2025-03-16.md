## 2025/03/16
- 0719 PM 😢 After spending some time sitting by myself, crying and contemplating, I began reading some verses of the Quran and asked Allah to remand me among those who associate none with Him.
- 0626 PM 😠 Why do I get attached so easily? Maybe I should renounce the life of love once and for all. I can't *love in moderation*, it's out of my control! And if being open to a romantic relationship brings me such painful and distracting emotions, then why bother with it at all? I think of Ibrahim. What would he have done? Was he ever distracted by similar feelings for someone? How did he deal with it? How did he overcome it? Am I too demented to put the grand vision of humanity on top of everything else?
- 0614 PM 💔 I am sad that I'll have to eventually part ways with *her* once we graduate from the college. What will I do then? Will she still want to be friends with me or will she avoid me for the rest of her life? Is this how my mom feels about my aloofness?
- 0609 PM 😞 I have a headache and I feel sad. I keep thinking about *her*. She doesn't think of me. I plunge into even greater sadness because I feel so powerless. Powerless to keep my mind off of her. Powerless against this headache, insomnia and my general lack of energy. Maybe this is not true. Maybe there is a way.
- 0511 PM 🤯 My brain really needs a break. I'm gonna take a walk.
- 0505 PM 👨‍🎓 Finished skimming the super long note about control statements in linux. Starting to read "Good Error and Usage Messages".
- 0432 PM 🤒 Studying OS. A wave of exhaustion hit me for a second. I could take another walk but that probably will not solve the issue. I'll drink some water. I could listen to music but I'll probably end up getting distracted and lose an hour or so. I could switch to calculus but it's only been about 30 minutes since I started with these OS notes so let's keep at it to complete two hours. So I should be done at 6:00 PM.
- 0406 PM 👨‍🎓 Just finished the co-op assignment. I haven't yet finished studying the Networking modules. I also wanted to finish the math assignment, but I still have a few days to finish it. We also have the final report draft to do, but we can probably put that together in a day or two. There's a OOP quiz tomorrow at 7pm so I'll brush up on the main topic on the same day, given there's a lot of time before the class. I haven't really looked at the new OS notes so I'll do that next.
- 0346 PM 🚶‍♂️ Took a break and about to start work again.
- 0326 PM 👨‍🎓 Still working on the assignment. I've identified 14 employers. This should be enough. Therefore, I will take a short break and start analyzing these employers and remove the least relevant ones.
- 0108 PM 👨‍🎓 Working on the assignment, but realizing it might take longer than expected. Planning to take a break around 2:30 PM.
- 1238 PM 👨‍🎓 The first step of this assignment is to identify potential employers. Some websites are already provided in the instructions. I need to identify five employers of interest in total.
- 1235 PM 🤷🏻‍♂️ I lost some time enabling always-on display on my phone and freeing up some space in it by deleting themes I don't use. About to start working on the research assignment right now and set a timer to track my progress.
- 1218 PM 👨‍🎓 About to start studying. I have to finish the employers research activity for my co-op course today, so I'll start working on that for 2 hours before taking a break and switching to something else.
