- 1327 : I am sitting down right now, procrastinating. Not sure what to get done first. In two hours I will be going to help [[Enissa]] move to her new appartment.
- 1448 : I took a shower and went to the livingroom to sit with Ibrahim, who had just arrived. We're waiting for Yasmine to get ready and Enissa will come pick us up.
- 1845 : I'm sitting with my sisters at Enissa's new appartment in Glebe. Enissa, Ibrahim and Chiheb went to return the moving truck and get Enissa's car back.
