What is my mission? What is my vision for my career and how does my mission towards Allah compare or contrast with it? I no longer really see my career as a means of changing the world. I have already presented a new model for global transformation. One that does not require much physical effort and little to no large-scale collaboration on the dimension of earthlings. But it does require lots of intellectual energy. What is it I want to build as a programmer? Will I be given the opportunity to build such a thing? Ultimately I want to create experiences that will enable people to get a better understanding of their role in this world, and basically present the new model of global transformation. In other words, my mission is tightly related to my mission towards Allah. Coding projects are particularly appealing because they never remain the same. They get updates, and usually the updates make the program better rather than worse. What is it I want to build? It’s a quran app, but it’s more than that. An app the gamifies the process of interpreting the scripture. Let’s recall, what’s the purpose of interpreting the scripture? To communicate with the real God. What or who is that? What does it mean to communicate with God?

What I call ‘the gamification’ of Quranic interpretation, I essentially mean a software that willl facilitate data entry into a database and searching therefrom.
