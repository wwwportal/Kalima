# Introduction

In most instances, Kitaab is written in arabic with a short alif, but in some cases, a long alif is employed[^1]. Why is this the case, and what could this word mean?

# Methodological approach

1. First, figuring out the metaphorical meaning of kitaab by asking about the function of the literal kitaab.

2. Investigate how this metaphorical meaning applies in key stories in that employ this word.

3. Reading all the ayat with the root KTB is not necessary. Instead, I will first focus on the anomalies, the ayat that really stand out due to their unusual usage based on the common meaning and differences in form.

4. I will find what the ayaat containing kitaab have in common, and then, once I've developed a satisfactory theory, I'll falsify it by comparing it to the normal form of kitaab with a short alif to verify whether my findings are unique to kitaab with a long alif or not. If is it not unique, then the distinction the Quran is trying to draw our attention to must be something else.

# Possible Meanings of Kitaab

- What is the function of a record or ledger? It is to sustain some information permanently or for long durations of time. This is why it is also used as decree or law, which is usually applied over long periods of time.

- Maybe one of the two refers to the memories of an earthling while another refers to the memories of a spirit.

- If this is an action as in the action of writing rather than a static object, a book, then this could refer to ability to write memories.

- If the most fundamental state of the universe is unbounded telesis, then we can perhaps model this reality as the uninterpreted state of the book. The set of uninterpreted symbols available for self-processing and self-configuring from which truth can be derived by means of self-imposed restrictions on this potential. The uninterpreted book does not mean anything by itself. How does interpretation arise from this uninterpreted state? We say that is it by means of the definition of the objects and relations in the book.

# Kitaab with a long Alif

2:235 وَلَا جُنَاحَ[^2] عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا عَرَّضْتُم بِهِۦ مِنْ خِطْبَةِ ٱلنِّسَآءِ أَوْ أَكْنَنتُمْ فِىٓ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَلِمَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ سَتَذْكُرُونَهُنَّ وَلَٰكِن لَّا تُوَاعِدُوهُنَّ سِرًّا إِلَّآ أَن تَقُولُوا۟ قَوْلًا مَّعْرُوفًا وَلَا تَعْزِمُوا۟ عُقْدَةَ ٱلنِّكَاحِ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ ٱلْكِتَٰبُ أَجَلَهُۥ وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِىٓ أَنفُسِكُمْ فَٱحْذَرُوهُ وَٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ

And

13:38 وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلًا مِّن قَبْلِكَ وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُمْ أَزْوَٰجًا وَذُرِّيَّةً وَمَا كَانَ لِرَسُولٍ أَن يَأْتِىَ بِـَٔايَةٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ لِكُلِّ أَجَلٍ كِتَابٌ

1. And indeed we had sent messengers before you, and we had remanded for them counterparts and pupils and it is not befitting for a messenger that comes to him signs except with the permission of Allahh, for every period of time is a record...

2. It is not befitting for a messenger to rely on his counterpart to write new memories in his mind except with the permission of Allah, for every ajal, is a unique writer of memories (appointed by Allah?)

15:4 وَمَآ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ إِلَّا وَلَهَا كِتَابٌ مَّعْلُومٌ

1. And we had not decimated a coterie except while she has a permanent knowledge.

2. And we had not decimated a coterie except while she an appointed writer of memories.

18:27 وَٱتْلُ مَآ أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ مِن كِتَابِ رَبِّكَ لَا مُبَدِّلَ لِكَلِمَٰتِهِۦ وَلَن تَجِدَ مِن دُونِهِۦ مُلْتَحَدًا

And recite what has been enjoined to you from the permanent syntax your lord does not change himself with criteria he came up with with regards to his words and you shall not find between him a refuge.

27:1 طسٓ تِلْكَ ءَايَٰتُ ٱلْقُرْءَانِ وَكِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ

1. Ta. Seen. These are the signs of the reading and the revealing permanent syntax.

2. Ta. Seen. These are the percepts (that result from) the (type of) reading and a clarifying (syntax for the) writing of memories.

[^2]: The root جنح (j-n-ḥ) generally refers to the sides of something, likely originating from the meaning of wings. Abstractly, it signifies an inclination toward something, as if approaching or standing on the edge. It also conveys kindness and humility, likely inspired by the image of a mother bird sheltering her young under her wings.

    The phrase "لا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ" (There is no junāḥ upon you) means "There is no blame/sin upon you," not "no protection." However, the concept of wings as evidence is intriguing: just as two wings are needed for flight, a hypothesis requires at least two supporting proofs. The idea of sides can metaphorically extend to proof, as evidence positions you on a particular "side" relative to a central idea or body. Sides are always defined in relation to something else, like the main body of an argument or structure.
