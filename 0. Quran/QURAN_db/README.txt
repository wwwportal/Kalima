The QURAN database for Windows
=========================

- Run the proQuran.exe file from your computer or laptop.

- For a full experience of this software, download one or more recitations of your choice (for offline mode), any translation audio/s in your own language/s, the additional Languages pack, and the Tajweed Mushafs if needed. Put all files in the same local folder.


First Time only:
===========
1. This program uses the .NET Framework 4.0 (or above).
If not already installed, download and install the framework.

2. If you get an "OLEDB provider not installed" message,
download and install the AccessDatabaseEngine (2007).

3. For best results download and copy the language fonts to your Windows Fonts directory. 

4. Press <more info> RUN anyway,
if you get an Unknown Publisher or unrecognized app message at first run.
