ald
today alhamdulillah we are back after a couple of weeks of uh of a break over the beginning of the new year and uh we are starting inshallah with segment yt7 YT 70 is uh sorry one YT 170 YT 170 as uh we see on the screen deals with
um a brand new issue uh that is a continuation of the prior issue that we have seen before uh the issue that we have seen before which is related to the usage of Allah in the Dua and we have said over two years ago that Allah subhana wa taala never instructed us to use Allah to the contrary we have said that using Allah is detrimental to our own
benefit and we should not use Allah today inshallah we're going to see just a little bit reinforcement uh as the thumbnail on the video on the live session today uh States we're going to see a little bit of reinforcement regarding this issue specifically um we're going to see a video that was published actually a while ago but it didn't come to my attention until about two weeks ago this video is
is from a professor of Arabic language and Arabic uh specialist and Quran specialist who has worked on the subject of the Quran and the Arabic for over 50 years of his life more like 60 years of his life he's very well received in the Arab world as an expert uh on the Quran especially the quranic use of uh traditional Arabic he doesn't really get too much as we have seen before
uh Dr F uh we have seen some of his segments before today's segment he insists as you will see he insists that the Quran only uses and for Dua only uses and for Dua he's aware of the five instances where Allah is used in the Quran and he insists those are not for Dua unfortunately as you will see yourself he doesn't go beyond
beond that he stops and he leaves the interviewer his host who interviewed him he leave that host sort of you know surprised he doesn't know where to take this new information and yet you can see as you will see by yourself you can see a million questions circulating all around um the host and all around the uh Dr Salah as
so we're going to get started immediately uh by reviewing first uh but but first we need to review what is covered in this segment so in this segment uh as you will see in this segment uh we are going to cover a bunch of information the first we're going to review uh this video this short you know one and a half minute uh uh you know segment cut out from the video but I'm going to give you
the full reference to the video and for those of you who speak Arabic you can enjoy it it's a longer segment about half an hour we're only going to focus on one minute and 15 seconds perhaps from that video and then we're going to remind you a little bit of what we covered in YT 78 and YT 79 which deals with the concept of Allah and how we have talked about this in in extensive details in these two segments a long time ago so
over a 100 uh approximately 100 segments ago we're also going to produce uh or provide you with new evidence regarding the paragraph from Surah yusf because if you remember in YT 78 we relied heavily on one specific paragraph specifically Ayah number 10 that tells us exactly that those who are rejectors use the word Allah not the Believers and we're going to see more detail we're going to revisit that and we're going to provide new
evidence that reinforces this explanation you're going to see this so this is worth it it's worth your time I promise you it's not going to be a very long segment even though we are GNA we're going to cover a lot of material and we're going to go through a lot of different surprises uh we're going to see new instructions regarding crafting Dua how to craft the Dua and how uh this important art form or this important aspect of our uh belief
or our relationship with Allah subhana wa tala we're gonna see how important it is in the Quran compared to how they did not really help us develop this ability to craft Dua to to weave the words and the sentences for Dua from inside the Quran we're GNA see very specific instructions and you're gonna be amazed like how come we never learned all of this how come none of the scholars none of the scholars who
who have um produced any recognizable work in the last 1,400 years none of them have really paid attention to The Specific Instructions given in the Quran regarding crafting the Dua the art of crafting Dua and by the way I invite you all to join us on the website to subscribe as soon as you can if you can afford it if you cannot afford it contact me at marvelous Quran atgma
mail.com and we will arrange for you to join us if you if you really cannot afford it but if you can afford if you can afford it please join us and subscribe to the website www.m marvelous quran. org and you can receive on a daily basis new Dua that have been crafted and weaved and sort of devised according to specific quranic words using the right meanings of these words
I'm saying using the right meanings of these words because this is extremely important as we will see so for the rest of this segment today inshallah we're gonna get into two specific quranic Dua this is a huge surprise this is a surprise you probably did not expect at all to quranic Dua specific quranic Dua that you see somebody saying these Dua but we must never use we must never use of course in YT 78 we saw
one of them and you're gonna hear Dr also talk about this so of course that Dua we should never use because it's using Allah and it's asking it's challenging it's sort of trying testing Allah subhana wa tal if you believe or if you're telling us we should believe this Quran is true then let it rain rocks
from the heaven that's what the Dua is saying of course we will never use that Dua that's that's very obvious but there are two specific quranic Dua that we're gonna see where actually supposedly San is is saying them soan is actually uh pronouncing such Dua we're going to see these two quranic Dua are not are not something we should use and this is new this is something you've never heard before this is something you will never
probably here anywhere else expressed um with confidence with evidence with knowledge directly from the Quran why these two Dua are something we should never use two different Dua from San we're going to see them and then we're going to see an unprecedented disclosure this understanding of uh parts of the story of Suman will break wide open the story of San according to the Quran according to
to the Quran and therefore you're going to see a lot of material in this segment yes in the past I've said the YouTube uh live YouTube live segments are usually lighter segments but as you will see alhamdulillah we are able to stuff a lot of heavy duty uh heavy duty material very Advanced material for those of you who are Advanced toilers if you are on the other hand new to this channel if this is one of the earliest videos you have seen or
your first encounter with uh with marvelous Quran please follow the following instructions and reminders please this is for your own benefit we keep saying them at the beginning of every video because they're important they're not just to fill space and to bore you so please listen to the instructions very carefully don't assume that you already know what this aat that we're going to present this ayat mean you don't understand what these ayat mean unless you understand the
proper terminology based on the Quran from the Quran itself not from outside so don't bring us translations that other people have done because it doesn't matter what they said they base their translations on the wrong assumptions of what these words the words of the Quran really mean the words of the Quran are defined within the Quran this is our methodology we look four definitions from within the Quran and we apply the the tools and the techniques and
the methods that we follow as part of the organic quranic methodology a methodology from within the Quran we use that methodology very carefully very diligently very deliberately in order to try to understand the words of the Quran on the quran's on terms on the Quran owns basis we don't make things up we look for Allah subhana wa T to guide us and this is called
linguistic discernment so please don't assume that you already know what the aats really mean because you don't we have never been told the proper way to interpret this aat we make extensive use of something called nested interpretation if you're not familiar with this you're probably going to be frustrated if you don't understand the abrahamic locution uh the set of terminology the vocabulary that Allah subhana waala chose Alim because ibraim himself
in the Quran made a Dua so Allah subhana wa T told us ibraim make that Dua made that Dua the Dua from ibraim was grant me a locution of truthfulness that is used by the later people the later people are the people to whom the Quran was provided including us alhamdulillah so the lotion of truthfulness is
ibraim the the locution of ibraim or that ibraim has instituted and made a Dua that the Quran the last Revelation so to speak the last scripture from Allah subhana wa tal to the later ones would be in the locution of ibraim so finally if you're not familiar with all of this please watch other segments start with much earlier especially yt46 and and and coming forward but more important than anything perhaps
make sure you watch YT 93 segment YT 93 it's a long segment but it's very foundational segment and it really teaches you how we think how we reflect about the language the locution of the Quran please invest those times or that time three hours in your life in yt3 I promise you you're G to be shocked you're going to be surprised at how much the Quran provides us information through this methodology which has been AB
in the last 1400 years in our tradition so I'll leave it for yourself but allow yourself the opportunity to learn what this channel is all about at least by starting with yt46 and coming forward but if you really are in a rush start with YT 93 don't go anywhere on this channel without watching YT 93 it is absolutely crucial all right so we jump directly um into the subject as
hand reminder of what we have covered in YT 78 and YT 79 uh please refer to these two segments and you can find them on the channel these are the thumbnails and as I said in here YT 78 where Muslims duped into cursing each other for 14400 years using the word Allah and YT 79 continues with the same subject and discusses frequently asked questions if I remember correctly there are 10 major questions including
what do we do with you know they they taught us Muhammad Muhammad etc etc what do we do with these with these utterances that we were taught and how do we convert them how do we convert them using this new knowledge that we should never use Allah never ever use Allah in your Dua never unless as we show in YT 78 that it's a curse word it's it's a
against somebody you don't like so if you really are using it for yourself or for your family it it it is understood by the Mala as something that's a curse so please don't use it again YT 78 provides the full detail we're not going to provide the details in this segment so YT 78 is where we've talked about this we've covered all five instances where Allah is used in the Quran and this is extremely
important because we often get asked questions about you know the aat that you know it says well we know this we understand this we have studied the Quran I have studied the Quran for 40 years so we're not bringing something uh you know without basis we understand all of the details we understand what you're talking about but please invest in learning the new things that you may not be aware of allow yourself the
humility and the modesty to learn what we cover in YT 78 watch it with full mind with full open mind with full open heart watch it with the Assumption of an empty cup that you're learning something new and be excited about this knowledge because Allah subh out of his Mercy is allowing us to learn uh these new things alhamdulillah let me check on how we're doing regarding the the chat and and the reception and the transmission uh please give me a thumbs up
up on the chat if you are uh able to hear me well and uh the video is everything is okay and so on and so forth all right very good alhamdulillah so it looks like everything is going well we will continue so let's go back to the um discussion so we're gonna switch directly to this video from Dr f as I promised to it's a one and one and a half minute maybe at most it's not even that long it's very
short and I'm going to stop it and translate what he's saying so that you understand uh exactly the importance of this segment and so that you uh you see for yourself that um uh we're uh we're um uh that we're in good company alhamdulillah so let me see how we can go there uh this is in the way here we go this is the segment uh I hope you can
see it um so we're going to start and I'm going to play the video and I'm going to stop it to translate exactly what he's saying for those of you who are speaking who are not Arabic speakers and by the way I included uh the link I included the link and I included uh all of the details regarding the the um the name of the video right here and the channel where it was published as I said this was published
a number of years ago three years ago but I know the recording of this session by Dr F took place a long time ago like 20 years ago so this is not new at all and he has known this for a long time it has come to my attention only in the last two weeks as I said so let's play without any further Ado and then I will stop it and translate as we go here we go
so he's talking about the Surah uh Surah 17 specifically the Ayah that says um and then he proceeds and he's talking about that Dua and say
my Lord have mercy upon them upon the two parents as they have raised me uh as a young person so he's focused on what that one part of the Ayah about the Dua and then he says let me repeat it one more time uh to make sure that you hear it
so he says explicitly he says this Dua is using the expression RI and then he says and never in the Quran has there been a Dua a supplication except using the expression let me repeat it so you guys can hear it on your own and uh those of you who are skeptical can refer to the video yourself I'm not I'm not changing it I'm not cutting it I'm actually playing it live
from YouTube so you can you can hear it so he says never in the Quran does the Dua occur except using not Allah he doesn't say Allah and then watch now now the interviewer I want you to focus on the face of the interviewer and watch his Expressions the expressions are are Priceless Watch What Happens
I hope you saw that expression on his face his expression is absolutely Priceless like stunned like what do we do with this information this this is huge and he asked there there is no Dua using my Lord my IL or Allah or he says no
so he says there is no Dua except one made by the rejectors by the C who say and they said Allah they used the the rejectors if this is from you this is the truth from you then Reign Upon Us Reign Upon Us rocks and stones dram continues he says
this is not a Dua look look at their faces now as they continue this conversation look at their faces he's saying what kind of a Dua is this he says it's not it's not it's Bring Down rocks upon us so they're they're cursing themselves in this Dua that's what he's saying and and why
watch the expression of the interviewer again and then he repeats it there is no Dua in the Quran except using the expression so R and as we have been saying for over two and a half years alhamdulillah since YT
78 as I showed you uh yourself so this is the whole segment or the part of the segment that I wanted to show you you're welcome to watch the whole thing it doesn't talk about this issue except in these few few seconds but he repeats it twice because it's that important I wna I want to show you the expression on the face of the interviewer as we continue and then he says even he says he adds so he knows
is or must be part of the Dua so as you see the expression on the face of the interviewer is is at the beginning initially shock like what do we do with this what where do we take this information and um as we saw in YT 78 we build on it we understand what it means and we apply we apply what it means to our life so we stop using Allah because Allah never taught us to
use Allah now I know you're asking well what about these hundreds of narrations and reports and and so-called Hadith and claims and what we hear from our IM and Scholars and Sheikh Allah this Allah that all day long what do we do with this information toss it out because Allah subhana T teaches us how to make Dua and supplication and how to make Salat how to go for Salat how to approach Salat Allah is the one who teaches us
we do Salat not because it pleases how we want to do it no it we we we we follow or pursue Salat because Allah instructed us to do so and therefore the how and the terms and the expressions and how we communicate has to be based on what Allah taught us not what we invent not what we invent this is what this whole segment is all about and you're going to see even when some
na supposedly used the wrong Dua Allah points out to us this is wrong don't use it you're going to see by yourself so we're going to continue with this segment and last but not least I want to remind you one more time please don't use Allah for Dua this is this is at the heart of the problems our um is facing we don't we we reject we reject what Allah teaches us and we make up our own
and we think we are better than what Allah taught us in the Quran how to craft the Dua how to approach Salat we provided clear evidence that the Quran invites Us in more than 100 examples more than 100 times the Quran is very clear it uses or in the Dua in the supplication this is the moral that Allah has provided for us knock Allah don't use Allah please so this is the subject of this
this video now we've looked at this video from Dr Asami here's the link again I invite you to see it I'm not making things up this is exactly the time stamp that we looked at from minute 1210 to minute 1310 you can watch it by yourself again and again you can watch the whole video this is the channel name from which I got this segment again I didn't download it I played it live for you I hope you were able to uh see it by yourself let me confirm that
um everybody was able to see uh the video as um um as uh you know it has been um uh provided all right please those of you who are U uh monitoring the chat I really appreciate your active monitoring um those who are here for their own agendas and for interjecting their own type of comments they're going to be removed without hesitation so please
please don't put yourself in a uh awkward position and be and and force force our facilitators to remove you from this chat session all right so let's look again at the rest of this video and continue inshallah with the presentation that we have planned for you so unfortunately what Dr ASI did not say in this video that we saw is um not to use Allah but he left it hanging there and you could see for your
shelf the face of uh the face of the presenter and you can see how he's shocked he's stunned like what do I do with this information what about Allah Dr himself did not say not to use Allah but it was clearly obviously this is what the message that he was delivering so what do we do with the hundreds of narrations as we explained this is something that drami did not talk about but we presented in YT 78 all right now
now we jump into a new part of this presentation regarding the new supporting evidence uh that's related to um uh that's related to uh something we presented in YT 78 so in YT 78 we covered all five instances all five instances that relate to Allah where Allah occurred in the Quran and we explained exactly where Allah came from and we explained that from an Arabic
point of view no one has the explanation don't believe any claims by anyone anyone who claims that Allah is an Arabic word no it's not it's not an Arabic word nobody nobody has the etimology the the linguistic uh derivation of Allah no one the only person who ever dared to offer is someone called ALB Ahmed alidi ALB Ahmed alidi a really well
recognized name in the Arabic uh Linguistics field uh lived in the second century if I remember correctly second century hij he came up with one empty opinion empty opinion baseless no evidence given whatsoever he says Allah means Ya Allah means Ya Allah almed Al his students siwe and his student IB jini followed suit and said the same thing so we got
impression that we have a whole bunch of people who agreed to that but that's not true the truth is almed Al is the first one and the only one who came up with this empty opinion empty because he did not provide any evidence he just said Allah means Ya Allah now the question that we asked in y t78 again is yaah Allah a an expression that we should use in our Dua and the answer is no yah Allah includes yeah yah which in
indicates that you're calling upon someone by his first name because you're trying to get his attention or you're calling one of many one of many so when you Sayed that means there are many other people in the room possibly and you're trying to get the attention of Ahmed so you say yeah Ahmed I'm calling Ahmed specifically or if there are multiple Ahmed then you you call yeah Ahmed
you know and you give the family name so the the term yeah is not even used in the Quran I know Y is used in the Quran but it has a different type of expression and different type of understanding and we explained that yeah in the case of RI RI the word RI is used in multiple meanings in the Quran including in the story of YF as we presented
return to your in that case your master the the master who determines your your actions and who leads you and so on so forth he's talking to the ex prisoner so Yousef was talking to the ex- prisoner he used the word your lord your master so when we say which occurs in the Quran using expression yeah and this the only time in another in another time it's used
and Allah subh is swearing by somebody saying in that case r is referring to one of many Masters pay attention who is the master teacher for Muhammad Sall alhi wasallam the answer is J so the messenger said which me messenger we don't know y oh my master because in that case
the Quran is drawing our attention to the fact that there is possibly more than one master and he is specifically referring to to the master who is not Allah in this case the master who is jiel coming to teach him coming to train him to so this is the foundation of understanding yeah so back to ALB Ahmed alidi who made a claim an empty claim baseless claim not linguistically
solid or based claim ALB Ahmed Al Farid is the only one who made that claim and it was an empty claim with no basis whatsoever everybody else followed uh suit and relied on aled but I went back to the claims by aled I found they're totally empty there's no basis for them he just came up with an opinion an empty opinion I'm not diminishing his importance
the importance of he's a very important grammarian and linguistic expert in Arabic I know that but in that one specific opinion he did not offer any basis for his opinion his students siwe and his student IB J followed suit and they referred to what their teacher said that's it that's the end of the story so Allah is not an Arabic word Allah as we showed is used from Hebrew basis from Hebrew Hebrew sources
refers to multiple deity multiple gods and we provided the evidence in YT 78 that was not the origin of our claim that was not the basis of our claim the basis of our claim was the Quran 100% but we provided some linguistic background as to why we should not use the word Allah so again in YT 78 we presented this uh this small diagram from Surah yunus starting with
aah 7 ending with Ayah 11 this short paragraph that refers to these five ayat and we've detailed them uh to death frankly really laid out all the full information now I want to pay attention because at that time some people uh challenged me and rightfully rightfully so so in this paragraph I want you to pay attention please this is really important I'm not wasting your time in this paragraph We said that a
seven includes two groups of information those the ones who don't aspire to receive directly from us and the ones who are oblivious to our sons two different groups of people they're not the same group of people and then we said the second group were never addressed in the next Ayah or two and then in Ayah 10
which is two aat later so remember the first one is aah seven and then eight and nine talk about something else and then Ayah 10 return to this group of people those who are oblivious to our signs those who are uh unattentive or sort of uh turning away and and sort of dismissive of our signs of the signs of Allah subhana tala this Ayah 10 talks against them talks against them talks about
specifically and this Ayah says their claim this is not it is not their invitation or supplication dawa and we detailed it in YT 78 their claim it's just a claim they made a claim just like Al made a claim he claimed that it says that Allah means Ya Allah it does not there's there's no evidence to this he did not present any evidence same thing their claim therein in what
what in their absent mindedness or obliviousness to uh to the signs of Allah their claim they in your way that's what they claim it's not a Dua it is not a way for us to emulate of course because Allah is talking about those who are dismissive and sort of not paying attention to the signs of course that's not us of course Allah subhana T is not inviting us
to emulate them their claim there they in your way Allah and the their claim therein also is that their salutation is Salam they claim that they are about Salam about peace and they use the word Salam and we said don't use the word Salam use the word as we were taught by the angels in the Quran and then the same Ayah ay 101 continues
and the last part of their claim the least of their concern is all praise is due to Allah the lord of the Realms so we said that this Ayah Ayah 10 is jumping over the prior to ayat Ayah eight and Ayah n to refer to a reference in Ayah 7 so this arrow in here you see this arrow down on the right side this arrow is the part that is unfamiliar to people well doeses the Quran do this the Quran does this all the time
so in this segment today I'm going to give you one more example where the exact same structure the exact same uh sort of distant reference distant reference so the reference in Ayah 1010 is not talking about indeed the ones who attained to Faith or you know believed and toil on the scripture in accordance with the Divine lexicon so those who believed in the past and work according to the Divine lexicon is
is mentioned in Ayah n Ayah 10 is not talking about this group of people here I I colored it in blue Ayah 10 is talking about a group of people who are much earlier a 7 so this jump in here which I represented by this blue arrow on the right side that you see this jump does the Quran do this often or does the Quran do it in other places so I'm going to show you in the next page in the very next page I'm going to show you the exact same structure
the exact same jump over in Surah 17 Surah Al is the the the important point of this uh of this paragraph is just to show you this this jump here on the right side that the reference is for a distant reference not for the nearer reference so watch in Ayah 8 Allah subhana wa tala is still addressing B is if you remember this is from the beginning of Surah Al is we've covered this in the
second segment that's part of the series on al- Mahi part two of al- Mahi we've covered this full detail so this this Ayah 178 this Ayah right here is referring to B is in the case of their rejection so Allah is talking about rejectors because that's the scenario that's being set up again go back to that segment refer back to the
second part of the series on al- Mahi and you'll see this uh full detail so they do so per chance your lord may have mercy upon you and if you return back to us he's addressing Ben Israel if you return back to us before they do so this is addressing us now we turn back from the second promise to Ben Isel and we have remanded Janam as a confinement for the rejectors so whoever reject
rejects the promise that Allah subhana T is giving in that segment again we explain it in full whoever rejects that promise Allah describes them as cine rejectors all right the next Ayah is talking about good people and very positive uh promise and sort of glad Tiding you'll see this Quran got
to that which is more persistently restorative and gives the Glad Tidings to the Believers Al so here here different subject different context this Ayah is a departure from the prior context I hope you see this so the Believers who toil on the scripture in according with the Divine lexicon that to them is a reward that gives them the correct opinion
this reward This Promise This glad Tiding this new uh sort of promise from Allah subhana T the Glad Tiding right here is for the Believers so the next Ayah is continuing seemingly the same discourse but it cannot be because this is talking to the Believers and giving them Glad Tidings good information good sort of Promise toward the future the next Ayah that to those who don't believe in the delayed diligent and understanding or
interpretation not the Believers those are the rejectors we have readed the Grievous punishment of Separation we have prepared for them a grievous punishment of Separation so this Ayah has nothing to do with the Ayah and the promise that's provided right before it so what does it refer to it refers to an Ayah that came earlier Ayah 178 so again this arrow in here is the reference
that shows how there is an intermediary AA that is of a totally different concept different context this is exactly what happened in that paragraph from Surah yunas as we saw up here so a seven is talking about a group of people who are oblivious to our signs and the flow of this thought the flow of this thought which started in aah 7 continues in Ayah 10 so
this Ayah 10 is talking about people who are oblivious to our signs meaning dismissive of our signs neglecting our signs they're not paying attention they don't want to learn from the Quran this group of people they use the word Allah this is exactly what this context is so Ayah 8 and Ayah n have nothing to do with Ayah 10 or with the group of ayat 10 so I just showed you again another pattern exactly like it where I
nine from Surah Al is has nothing to do with the relationship between Ayah 8 up here and Ayah 10 down here this is a different Surah of course I hope you understand it just happens to be the same number aat uh that that provide us the supporting evidence so this is supporting evidence it's not direct evidence it's just explaining that we have corroboration this style that's being used in the Quran in the paragraph from Surah yunus up here is
is repeated again in other places and I just need to show you one this is enough of an example to sort of illustrate that we are on the right track that we're not making things up we're following the style the compositional style and and the the the the way the Quran presents this information to people who are awake to people who are awake one last comment here again I want to go back to the paragraph from story from Surah eunus from story uh sorry from Surah number
10 pay attention to something really important I've mentioned it before but this is really interesting aah 7 is talking about people who are oblivious to our aat oblivious to our signs and then this paragraphs gives us eight and nine talking about something else and then returns to ayat 10 to talk about the same group again the same group who were oblivious to our signs not paying attention to our signs
and this is the example this is a beautiful example Allah is telling us look there are some people who are not paying attention watch I'm going to play this trick and you're gonna see you're gonna see that they're not GNA pay attention sure enough sure enough if you go through the books of T not a single book of tap caught that Ayah 10 is not talking about the Believers mentioned in aah n they immediately thought aah 10 and aah
nine are the same group of people in other words they have been absentminded from our signs just like a 7 predicted they will do so Allah subhana wa tala is telling us there's a group of people who are going to be not paying attention to our signs and he gives us an example in the same paragraph and we've seen this happen many times before in other places he gives us the example right in the same place in the same paragraph and then he comes back to show us that there are people who did not pay ATT
attention to the signs just like as he told us in aah 7 all the books of fell into this trap this trap and I challenge you to find me anybody who really understood this correctly that is not referring to the Believers of a n it's referring to the rejectors and and absent minded people of as7 find me a book of T who really caught this
you can't you can't find a book of T who really did not fall into this trap and yet Allah is telling us there are some people who are absent minded from our signs they're not paying attention I'll leave the conclusion to you all right alhamdulillah so we've explained to you that there's always always uh supporting corroborating uh knowledge that that we find in the Quran and I've promised you many times
before Allah subhana wa tala has provided us this uh not not to allow it to to be defeated alhamdulillah we have been able to present this again and again with full evidence confidence and information and knowledge from within the Quran we don't make things up we allow the Quran to help us and to provide the evidence all right we uh we are going to keep moving let me check how we're doing on the on the chat and everything else there are lots of questions um
um so let me see if I can take a couple questions before before we proceed again please don't uh don't address your uh chat messages to um to each other address them to me as much as possible and inshallah we're going to take your questions uh to the best of our ability there is a u request for for us to pin
the video link in the chat uh or in in actually I'm going to pin it in the comment stream below the video um and I hope that uh that you guys can confirm and watch it later uh I want to I want to make sure that you understand please we have moderators who are helping us keep this chat from uh being distractive we want you to focus on what I'm presenting and if you have questions about what
what I presented you are definitely welcome and I encourage you to ask questions uh I know I apologize the audio of drami was not very clear that's fine I will put the link and I've translated exactly what he said and hopefully you'll get to see it and watch it for yourself uh later if you want okay so um uh let's see I I want to look for uh examples or questions uh there's a question
from Yin another example of how we learn how to understand and apply the locution through the correct through the context of the words yes exactly um I don't see a lot of question here from s is there no POS possibility Allah is from no it's not it's it's a different letter altoe with a with a uh Allah like Allah has a it's a different letter altogether I know they
they don't come out clearly uh when I present them or pronounce them in front of you but I assure you there's different basis and there is no etimology there's no Arabic atmology there's no Arabic derivation uh link so to speak that takes the word Allah to anything known to any root to any word that's from the Arabic language so the only again one more time the only person who made that claim is ALB Ahmed
farahi a famous linguistic uh expert I agree but he just came up with this his opinion with no basis he did not offer a basis so he says it means Ya Allah and we have proven even Ya Allah is not acceptable the AL farid's student whose name is siwe picked up that same opinion and repeated it and his student IB jinni also picked up the same opinion from their original teacher so
this is it this is all we know about this word nothing else is available no one can make any other claim don't believe them because they're just making things up they're just making things up where did you come up with this opinion he didn't offer any evidence that's it he says well C said this or alidi said this yeah but where did they base their opinion on again it's empty just thin air like you know as as well without giving any more examples uh here's a question from uh
brother Omar this is J is is Janam different for X person and Y person persons who have different good bad Deeds does Allah judge everyone in accordance with what they earned what can happen in that Abode of fire uh again we've talked about Janam uh on the channel there's a whole video about jahanam and we detail it um and then we talked about uh using the mq live the zoom sessions that we have on the first

I hope you stay with us because remember toward the very end we're going to crack open wide open the story of San so those of you who are with us and who are patient are going to learn quite a bit today I promise you so we're gonna get started with a surprising quranic Dua that we must never use we must never use it's in the Quran yes you will see we should never use it because it is given to us as an example of what not to use of how the locution can be abused
Abed and you're going to see for yourself Dr hany are you saying San used that Dua and yet he abused the locution yes you are hearing me correctly and this is exactly what I'm saying and we're going to see it and we're gonna pre provide provide the evidence the beginning evidence we're going to continue with the full detailed presentation about San in the mq live remember the mq live is the first and the third week of every uh month so next week
next Sunday there's going to be an mq live and those who are subscribed on the website will get to continue the story of San with us in more detail today I'm only gonna crack open the story I'm gonna I'm gonna provide you some intriguing information just like Dr as Sami did he provided the Intriguing information and left the questions hanging for your own thinking and reflection today we're going to do the same thing I'm going to present the information basic information
to to sort of tease your mind to help you start thinking to wake up to not be inattentive as we saw from Surah yunus Ayah 7 don't be inattentive pay attention be observ observant all right so Ayah 15 from Surah 27 Surah 27 is uh Surah an typically translated as the ant you're gonna receive a
an amazing disclosure today about what a NL refer to by the way every one of those disclosures could have been put on the thumbnail and they would attract a lot of views I'm sure but um I wanted to lead with Allah because that is the most important practical aspect of what we teach the most important excuse me the most important practical aspect is how to communicate
with Allah subhana wa tala using the proper way to craft the Dua to devise to compose the Dua this is the most important aspect of what we teach that's why we want you to join the website so that you can receive the daily Dua that we send to our members so that they can receive and and see for themselves the examples all right Ayah 15 from
and we have allowed D and to learn evidence-based knowledge allowed them to learn evidence-based knowledge and they both both of them together and remember we've seen this before in the case of ibraim when or in the case of of M and Haron both of them are speaking it doesn't mean both of them are literally
uttering the words one of them is speaking but they are together and they both said praise be to Allah who has favored us over many of his believing Wafers so pay attention the first thing they said is alhamdulillah they recognized uh they recognized Allah subhana wa tala as the source of knowledge so here we have the and suan the and suan later on inshallah we're going to die die
into the personality of D this is not for today but today we're going to focus Onan soan was with d and then we continue with Ayah 16 andan inherited the woodan inherited the wood and he San declared oh people pay attention now this is a different style he
here Allah subhana wa T is showing us what they said when the wood was alive here San is speaking pay attention to what's not there and that's the first hint that you start learning that there's something different about San something intriguing about San something not right about Salan you're gonna see for yourself and he suan declared oh people those of you who know Arabic you're
years have perked up already we have been taught what do you mean we have been taught who taught you well you should say Allah he did not say that we have been taught he left it in the sort of unknown uh style of of the verb of the form of the verb we have been taught the expression of he's using the word in the right way the the angels of course he's referring to the Mala of course but he's saying
we have been taught he's not giving credit to Allah subhana tala number one number two and we have been allowed to learn from everything in the scripture everything in the scripture Allah subana is saying we have allowed and to learn evidence-based knowledge not all of it not all of it here he's saying everything
everything really how do you know how do you know you've learned everything think about this for just one second and you'll realize there's something wrong that's number two this indeed is Al the clarifying F the clarifying benediction received during the days directly from Allah of course in his mind he understood with the word Al whether or not the people to whom he was speaking understood that's a different story
but that's that's the bragging that San was making immediately we see this from the first Ayah don't believe me you're going to see you're gonna see a lot more but right away we seean is talking to oh people oh man kind oh oh people to whom he's addressing himself so there's there's bragging he's talking to people Allah is telling us again this is how we learn from the Quran whereas Allah subhana wa tala is
is referring to the wood and what they're saying alhamdulillah to whom is the talking to Allah communicating to Allah and he's recognizing that all praise belongs to Allah and Allah is the one who favored us with benei Ben uh Ben benefici with uh sorry benediction uh over many others over many others is not exclusively above everybody else
is not exclusively above everybody else this is from Surah 276 15 but 2716 he says Allah has taught us everything so he's putting himself above all others immediately we see this from this ay so this tells us there is something questionable about suan immediately we we recognize this but this not enough this is sort of pointing Us in that direction now we're going to learn more
the word by definition is referring to for those of you who have watched the mq live and for those of you who have learned about the the the concept of afterlife model according to the Quran the concept of hasher is bringing someone who has died bringing the NFS of that someone and stuffing the NS of that someone into a living human being into
to a living human being so the letter Lee can be used in the Quran to mean for or against so uh so in the case of of suan he had Legions Legions and we're going to see what those Legions are doing some of them are from the Jinn and again we've defined the Jin in YT 74 if you have not watched that segment
it's really critical for this Channel and you really owe yourself to understand owe to yourself to understand what the word Jin really means it's not what they taught us it has nothing to do with these invisible you know sneaky creatures that operate in the dark and that kind of no it's not it's a human being who described as Jin because he has certain characteristics that are clearly defined in the Quran please go back and watch y74 to learn and to free yourself from the
ression of the fables and the myth and and the superstitions that we were taught for 14400 years so the word Jin is referred to that type of human being who is under uh under his own predilections and biases and cannot Escape them and we've seen this described very accurately in YT 74 so to suan there are Jin meaning NPS of people who used to be Jin
and nefs of ins and for his own benefit some of the the Angels so they are they are summoned foran immediately we have to stop and think well there are three different groups of people in here Jin and in and and their functions are different yes absolutely true so this Ayah
continues and thus they are they are dispersed what is that mean they are dispersed the word we use it in Arabic to distribute to take something that's a collection of things to take a group and to distribute it in parts to various directions in various directions that's so that person has a criteria of some sort has criteria of some
sort or justification for taking a group of of items a collection of some sort that's together and to kind of break it apart and distribute it in many different directions that's we use it in Arabic every day every Arabic speaker uh knows that word the root for this the root for this is so this form is the sort of unknown the subject is unknown who is causing them
to be dispersed well dispersed not only dispersed but they are instructed to lead San Remember by definition means they're brought to guide or misguide suan so who are they the three groups in here some of them for the benefit ofan Angels but others to what to do what to disperse the thinking of San to disperse the
the decision abilities of suan into multiple desperate chaotic directions I hope it's really clear so the word is used in the Quran in about half a dozen places if I remember correctly and none of them is a positive way none of them is used in a positive way pay attention none of the half a dozen times where the root in here is used in a positive way why is this important because in two aat
so man is going to use it in his own Dua for himself and you're going to see he's mocking he's mocking the Lexicon Dr Hanny San is a prophet and he's mocking the Lexicon yes he is and you're gonna see it with your own eyes you're gonna hear the Quran telling us this I'm not making it up you're goingon to see just wait few more minutes and you're going to see it for yourself so they are
us they are dispersed or dispersing dispersing the knowledge and the information and the decision making abilities of suan you remember for the last several months I've been telling you when you learn the methodology of the Quran when you engage the Quran to understand the and when you see things correctly the Mal help you trim and clean up and PR your valion and
thus you start seeing reality better and you make better decisions I've been telling you this and we have a segment about making good decisions etc etc here it's the opposite Allah subhana wa tala provided to suan and against him some an who were they were stuffed they were summoned to mislead him to misguide him or to guide him and therefore he had so many conflicting
inputs coming into his mind into his NFS his own NPS and Allah describes this process as they are causing dispersion they are causing disparateness in his own thoughts he can't figure out right from wrong there are so many different pointers coming through his mind why because the from the Jin and ins are conflicting with what
are telling him and he can't make heads or tails from what he's receiving this is the first introduction now does this Jive does this coordinate with what we saw up here in the way he's speaking yes it does so this paragraph is already teaching us something very crucial very dangerous about suan and we continue by the way could this be happening to any of us of course it can that's why this Ayah and this paragraph and this story
is there in Surah we're going to see and you're going to learn the conclusion by yourself inshallah that this this is very applicable to all of us then the next Ayah really interesting Ayah that mentions an the ants supposedly and you're gonna see has nothing to do with the insects it is something that's much more beautiful part of albate that was used in the story ofan is referring to ANL again we've seen this in in the
story of Al Allah subhana uses these types of insects not really because the word itself is what matters the insect itself what matters is the the metaphorical representation that these insects provide provide to us so in this case what is a NL what is the ant now I want you to step back and think NL the ant they live in underground underground networks and linked Chambers
and linked Ravines of Pathways and flows underground under the surface of the ground I hope you saw the image so so ants live under the surface of the ground under the surface of the Earth under Al Under The Superficial layer so ants are those who Dig Down Below The Superficial let me repeat it ants
NL in the Quran is not referring to that insect except in its representation from a metaphorical point of view the ant is the like ad like those who crawl on the on the surface of the scripture of course that's a and then they dive down below the surface that's the ant and NL so hopefully we're all NL diving below the surface not staying
at The Superficial layer avoiding what Ayah six and seven from Surah alah taught us so aah six and seven and go back to the series on uh on Surah alah especially the part that deals with the companions of the crest sorry the companions of the cave we've talked about those and we've said these two aat specifically are warning us
not to accept the zena layer the layer of the superficial uh part of the text that is not the intended meaning so here The Superficial layer of the text is talking about ants ants and not only that but a river of ants you know a w a river a big flow of ants well obviously this is a superficial layer we're supposed to dive below the superficial and understand the metaphor
orical representation so until when they have arrived arrived or they came against came against the this word right here so what happens then so by the way W refers to the flow of those who take refuge and toil below the zena of the Earth in other words below the superficial layer of the scripture
and they flow between the jel that's why they're referred to as Wy which means Valley except Wy is not spelled with a yah in here pay attention so this is W without a y what does that mean it's the actual flow that runs through the the river well the rivers are usually in valleys between mountains rivers are in valleys between mountains between Jal so what are the jibal jibal are the compositional units again this is a lot of technical terms
from the abrahamic locution those of you who have watched prior segments and have followed uh have no problem whatsoever understanding what I'm saying those of you are frustrated it means you did not follow the instructions I gave you at the beginning which is to go back and watch the earlier segments until you familiarize yourself with the abrahamic locution so let's continue so Wy is the flow the flow of people who are diving deep down and taking Refuge taking Refuge
and toiling below the superficial layer of the scripture I hope the image is very clear so Allah is describing them as a Wy a huge flow a huge sort of uh uh torrent of of many many people okay so what happened in the aah before well the Ayah before is talking about San and his Legions some of his Legions and he was given
against him and for him some Jin and some ins and some angels Mal and they're driving him in many many conflicting potentially chaotic desparate directions so he's not clear in the guidance he's receiving this is the image that we're given and they came against this group of people the flow of many people who are going in the right
Direction but diving below diving below the zena level of the scripture I hope the image is really clear so who are the good people andl in this scene the good people are ANL who is the bad group of people they came against they came against them against the good people who and his Legions by the way take out of your mind any kind of military camp
pain or anything like that has nothing to do with that Allah is clearly talking about San and all the influences that are occupying his mind please be patient there's a lot more to this so I'm setting up the scene so you understand exactly what these aat are saying so we continue with the translation so they came against W NL I explain what w NL is the flow or the torrent or group of people
who are diving in between the Jal meaning they recognize the they recognize the T the importance of T Di verication and they're diving below the superficial layer and one of them said one of the n one a singular one said and by the way this is feminine she said OHL OHL she's referring to
to her kind so to speak using the same word enter your source of Tranquility last L San and his Legion Legions Crush you while they perceive it not while they perceived it not
now pay attention we established that an are a good group of people who are doing the right thing and uh persistent in their toiling and they consider below the superficial layer of the scripture their source of Tranquility we all feel it if you are watching me now inshallah you feel it too below the superficial layer is where the wisdom and the nuggets and treasures are so this is the the attribute of n this is
this is a new disclosure never before discussed anywhere no one has come forward and talked to you about a as we are talking about it right now this is a this deserves its own segment to be honest with you but there's so much new disclosures in this presentation you're GNA be amazed so what is a NL one of the NL saying to her peers she's saying take refuge in take refuge in Tranquility where
below the superficial layer why because San otherwise would crush you crush you where if you remain at the zena layer at the top of the surface the image is so striking so stunning so beautiful and the metaphorical representation in this one aah to be honest with you deserve not only it's on video segment deserves its own book it's a huge disclosure a huge metaphorical image
presented in this one Ayah what else do we learn from this one Ayah she is describing or Allah is describing the group ofan and his Legions as where did we see this before we saw it in Surah y Allah describes the siblings
after they plotted to take away and kidnap Yousef and to send him into I'm not going to tell you what it means you have to watch the full series on Yousef to really appreciate what that means this group of siblings Allah described them Allah described them as and they do not they do not perceive they do not perceive they don't perceive not just they don't perceive it they don't perceive period
so they don't have a good perception sense of perception who are we talking about in this case in this Ayah it's very clear Allah is describing and his Legions as the exact same description given to the siblings in the early part of Surah yusf this is how we learn from the Quran this is the the Quran teaching us we're not making it up I'm showing you one step at a time how the story is
is unopening unfurling sort of the are opening up to reveal a totally different story below the surface the traditional interpretation remained at the zena layer this story is teaching us to dive down below we continue it gets more beautiful I promise you and more stunning more surprising more shocking this is the part that's really shocking here every
book of T every book of translation told us he smiled wide at her he's happy with hearing and some people said well suan was able to hear the ants as they crawled on the earth no he's not that that's a lie that there's nothing in the Quran that that um that implies this if you understand it metaphorically and now you understand this Ayah very carefully you see a totally different image come into focus and you understand something totally different watch
the word means he smiled okay but it never occurs in the Quran and no it has nothing to do with bahas is not related to Allah this is the proof please pay attention open your mind open your heart learn from the Quran Allah does not do because the word the only time used in the Quran is in the case of not in a good context you're gonna see
this includes the expression the the phrasal verb so remember the phrasal verbs are uh a string of a verb plus a preposition so like we say come in or come out or to break in or to break out those expressions phrasal verbs means something different just because they have something in common the verb come or the verb break
it does not mean they mean the same thing so the same thing in Arabic we saw this so many times in the story of Yousef and many other places so and we also saw it regarding we said does not mean supporting or approving of but means to correct mean to accuse the other of something wrong and to bring the correction to
correct something else that was uh stated in the wrong so the Quran is correcting everything that was reported uh of the related stories in the Quran otherwise the Quran would not be in need of repeating the same stories so that's a phrasal verb same thing in here now I challenge all of you to go search in the Quran for
this phrasal verb so this is the root and is the preposition that follows within that phrasal verb every time it's used in the Quran it means laughing at someone laughing at someone meaning mocking mocking someone are you shocked yes you should be because not a single book of T not a single book of translation caught this
it's so simple just search for throughout the whole Quran and you find it jumps at you this is not a good description of what happened with suan this is a clear indication that suan was mocking this good group good group of people described as W are you shocked you should be if you're not shocked stop the video later on after the
live and Rewind and listen again and you're going to be amazed now this sets up the context why is this so important because the Dua in this a is not a good Dua what's the proof he's mocking her he's mocking the aunt the aunt said some things that are good and he's mocking at her he's laughing at her so this is not
the the context they taught us in the last 14400 years it's the exact opposite 180 degrees I wish I can see your faces I wish I can see your comments um yes uh sister AI ants were smart well ants and NL were smarts and Waring warning people not to engage with Suman and his likes because he will confuse them absolutely 100%
this is number one lesson that we learn from this from this uh paragraph that we're reading it's not just about Dua now we understand the context I promised you I promised you when you learn the Quran you start seeing reality clearer and I've been telling you don't associate with people who have the potential to mislead you because they are like this story of NL and suan let's continue with um with the story and you're going to be amazed I promise you this seg
m is only going to get better and better and better and you're going to be amazed because there's a good closure for this story toward the end and again during the mq live next week next Sunday we're gonna dive a lot more detail into the story of Salman let's talk about the first Dua the first Dua that San made and we should never make why because Allah is telling us he is mocking laughing at her while he's saying that so this is not a good Dua what is the Dua
he said it starts with r it doesn't matter this Dua is bad is wrong we should never use it if I've used it in the past which I'm sure I've included it somewhere in the last four years I apologize please disregard uh my advice in the past this Dua is not a Dua we should use by the way this is part of the self-correcting methodology we're going to see a little bit more about this in the next uh few few
in the next half an hour maybe all right so what did he say do you remember they are dispersed what does that mean dispersed that their mental their mental guidance their spiritual guidance is confusing chaotic disperate not focused not helping it is taking that person in so many different directions so he says do the same thing to me
do the same thing to me you're going to be shocked in the next two sentences all the translations all the books of T said so that I thank you for your favors upon me so that I thank you wrong l i communicate with you according to the favor that you have bestowed upon me and my two parents
means l meaning I don't want to meaning if you don't if you don't cause me to be dispersed and distracted in multiple chaotic disperate directions um then I will be uh thankful but I don't want to be thankful that's what he's saying literally he's saying I don't want to be communicating with you in exchange for your
favors can anyone do this yes he is he is mocking her words he's mocking her he's using words that sound correct but they are exactly the opposite of what they mean well where do you get this from N means L let's look at the notes down here and you see I laid out in full detail in the notes that you're going to receive by the way if you are subscribed on the website you will receive these notes
notes if you're subscribed at level two or above you receive these notes so there are I'm only going to share with you three examples there are tons of examples where n n the preposition n here n is used to mean l meaning to not to to he doesn't want to do that he doesn't want to be Ash communicating with Allah here's one example from Surah 5 a 19
all people of the book or cohorts of the scripture you has arrived to you our messenger who clarifies who exposes to you uh after a period of abena of of absence from other Messengers so after a period without Messengers you have received our messenger this is what the Quran is talking to the cohorts of the book and then it continues and
lest you say meaning in other words we don't want you to say lest you say that we have never received a a Warner or a harbinger of glad Tiding so means lest you say another way of saying it so that you don't say so that you don't so that you don't so here
so that I don't so that I don't communicate in exchange for the favors that you have bestowed upon me and my two parents so this is one example I give you two more examples in here one from a Surah Al 1551 156 and you can read it and one from Surah Al 7172 and there are tons of others the word or the expression n the expression n the the article is a negation article it means
means so that not so that not so here lest so that I don't communicate with you so he's saying disperse me create in me desper desperate chaotic directions so that I don't communicate with you he doesn't want to communicate with Allah this is what this Dua is saying it is it is absolutely the opposite of what the superficial layer is saying
are you shocked there's more watch this has stopped me for a long time because at the surface it says and so that I uh toil according to the terminology that pleases you well it sounds good ah but there is n in the beginning the same meaning and L un l andless
best I toil using the correct terminology of the scripture that pleases you again why is he doing this he is mocking her he's mocking the namla he is laughing at her he is making fun and sort of making light of the seriousness of the terminology and he's composing words that mean the exact opposite of what a regular reader reading The Superficial would understand are you shocked
this is what this Dua is saying we continue we continue it doesn't stop so so far we have we have two sentences the third sentence and admit me admit me using your Noble visitors or Noble visitors from you among your Wafers watch how it's spelled you remember with a short
versus with a long and we've clarified this in in a segment like a month ago we said with a long is referring to I in this life I with a short is referring to in the afterlife the good Wafers of in the afterlife meaning those who won after their death who won good things and succeeded we given the good news but in this life have not finished the test
what is he saying he's saying I don't care about with a short afterlife I want to be in here in this life is this the right way of making this Dua no it's the wrong way of making this Dua so whenever you ask Allah to make you among your think short think after your death that's the vi
victory that matters not in this life in this life as long as you're alive you're subject to trials and tribulations and possibly making mistakes in this case he's asking for the long El if how do we know this Allah told us that this is what he's thinking this is how he thinking he's thinking long if not short if that's why it's written in the Quran that way well didan know how to write long short that's the
what matters what matters what he's thinking and Allah is teaching us what He is thinking so he's presenting Allah is presenting to us how it's written to show us how San was thinking this is the power of our methodology of the methodology that we're using Allah is showing us how suan is thinking so he's thinking about this life he's not thinking about the afterlife what's the evidence he's mocking her this
Dua is absolutely stunning and at the same time it's something we should not come near or repeat or utter if you have memorized it forget it never use it even though it says RI well but Dr hany the same Dua occurs somewhere else I know I'm gonna cover it I'm gonna show you I'm gonna show you how the exact same Dua is used in another Surah but it means something slightly different or the conclusion of it is something different
so now we understand this paragraph from Surah 27 in contrast we see the exact same Dua used in Surah 46 Surah Al in Ayah 13-19 so let's uh take a quick pause in here see how we're doing on the number of questions we have uh um is this when he is still in training or after being
being sent as a NE yes both both but the clarity here is that the clarity that we saw so far is that San was um San was misguided by the fact that he asked he asked for cause cause this Spirit Direction in my head so he made that Dua in laughing guess what Allah gave it to him that's the danger of these ayat
Allah gave it to him even though he was making this Dua in laughing and mocking he was mocking her Allah gave it to him Allah gave him this desperate chaotic sense of no no clear Direction so he started doing more and more mistakes all right let's continue with um with the segment uh and then this is the same Dua but in a different context in Surah
I know the same Dua occurs in more than one place in two places so let's read this one I want you to pay attention to the tone to the tone of this paragraph it's different than the other one the other paragraph from Surah 27 is telling us how San made the mistake and was mocking and making fun and laughing at the terminology here
the tone starts with those who say our Lord is Allah and then sought self-correction immediately you understand then sought self-correction they corrected themselves this is a different context this is telling us the rest of the story this is telling us the rest of the story of suan and we're going to see how impactful and significant this new discover
is to understanding the story ofan throughout the whole Quran you're going to see so be patient so but the clear theme is that they have sought self-correction in other words they were making mistakes before and they came back and fixed some of those mistakes during their life yes and perhaps more they shall not there shall not be any fear upon them nor they shall be saddened
so self-correction by definition necessitate that number one you're always reflecting you're always willing to admit that you made mistakes and you're always willing to repair those mistakes this brothers and sisters is what this channel is all about for me I'm repairing self-correcting the many mistakes I've made and in the process I'm hoping to help as many people as possible emulate this
behavior for their own good for their own sake not to admire Dr hany I don't care about that but to admire yourself when you succeed in recognizing you made a mistake you made a mistake in in the past about believing or understanding in a certain way and turned out to be wrong fix it move on don't allow the seed to ruin the rest of your Val don't allow this this sort of defective seed to ruin
the rest of your pluck it out clean it up and move on with a clean until you discover the next mistake and this is what life is all about this is self-correction this is this is a clear indication here the tune or sorry the tone of this paragraph is about this what happens to them
these are the companions of J alhamdulillah inshallah we are among them dazing therein they're in days they they spend their time just before sleep that the few moments of of half Consciousness we call it days d a z days daing therein in Al that means receiving in these these beautiful disclosures some of them I'm
sharing with you in in every segment that we do as a recompense ja as a recompense in accordance with what they have been toiling that's why we keep telling you you toil during the day with the eyes open observing reading thinking reflecting while you're awake conscious and then you head to sleep write those few moments or seconds or fraction of a minute before you sleep that's called the period of days the days
z d a Ze and you have the download the flash of receiving from Allah subhana tala as a recompense and inshallah you will be among how do you feel it you feel it the next day or the next week or the next month when you have a sudden recollection ahra Allah is flashing in your mind something that has been deposited a long time perhaps before a long time when during the days
inshallah we will be among them so who is this referring to in this case who have theyve sought self correction meaning they made mistakes before is this possibly talking about suan yes it is we're going to see it the next Ayah
and we recommended to the divinely guidable man through his parents who instructed him with insightfulness this is different translation different interpretation from what we taught we were taught this is not no
B this letter B should make us think we recommended to the divinely GU man through his parents be so the from Allah to the insan came from his parents which parents who instructed him with insightfulness I hope you're understanding how different and significantly different it is from what they taught us this is not talking about our own parents this is talking about the process that Allah set up
for yes I'm I'm breaking out huge disclosures in here hints right and left for those of you who are Advanced toilers we recommended we provided a recommendation how be day he using his parents which parents who provide him instructions with insightfulness not just any parents so this is not talking about your responsibility to your parents this is a this is
talking about a specific insan directly guidable man that Allah is talking about in this paragraph and how he was instructed he was instructed through his parents through his parents this is this is the preposition of the instrument the instrument are his parents the instrument for providing this direct guidance or direct recommendation from Allah is the parents which par
parents who provide insightfulness who provide Insight are you listening parents this is the the function in the role of a good parent I apologize I'm starting to lose my throat or my voice I should say very good so now we're talking about a specific inan we're talking about
specific person guidable man is it possibly man we're going to see his mother carried him or carried a burden for him she hated it she she did it with reluctance and she put him down pay attention doesn't mean she delivered that means she put him
down we're going to see when did she put put him down do you remember an do you remember an who spoke against they don't perceive this is not a good description for suan who do you think that n was Allah is telling us she is the one who put him down she's the one who used terms or terminology against
why because they came against them in the first place they came in opposition to what this W were doing so she spoke out she carried the burden for him she knew him she's speaking the first first uh noun basis first name basis about San she knew him directly so that namla guess who she is she is his mother and
here Allah subhana T is saying she hated she hated to be speaking ill of him but she did she spoke ill of her own son she spoke ill of her own sonan and Jun who his Legions here Allah subhana T is saying they did their part they did their part they trained him correctly just as we saw in the case of Isa and his and and his mother and
and his two parents before they did their part but Allah subhana wa T is telling us she carried the burden for him uh with reluctance while she hated she hated it she didn't like it does that give us a hint about the conditions of her original pregnancy Perhaps Perhaps but she put him down also reluctantly she hated doing it but she had to do it she had to tell people
uh about what's going on and carrying the burden for him and her later separation from him included 30 declarations what does that mean we'll talk more about this in the future so it doesn't mean 30 months 30 declarations what does that mean we're going to refer to this later remember s it means unproductive group of people unproductive generation
or unproductive person all of those are part of Sena so until when he reached his strength his full strength he became very strong very powerful and his erronous ways were delivered 40 unproductive times 40 unproductive times so now we we understand excuse me now we understand that
there is there is a period of time that went on where suan was doing something wrong and his own his own mother put him down she spoke you know she spoke against him why because he came against her he came out against her as we saw in the prior paragraph from Surah remember this is Surah Al a different paragraph but the tone is different so until when he reached this this period of thir
30 declarations and uh 30 yeah declarations and 40 40 unproductive times he declared delivered his erroneous ways then he finally said the exact same Dua which is possibly right this time possibly right but it's actually wrong because we we saw this person
me in disparate chaotic directions he's using the exact same terminology lest I communicate with you according to the favor that you have bestowed upon me and my two parents and lest I toil using the correct terminology of the scripture that pleases you so far so good it matches word for word the prior Dua he's made but remember now Allah is telling us he's entering a new phase and the tone of the paragraph the whole tone of the paragraph starting with this Ayah
is telling us so this Dua does not stop at it continues and later he said this is how I'm interpreting this Dua and later he said provide me of the correct Divine lexicon through my progeny please pay attention because this is really stunning why is he saying
through my Pro progeny provide me the knowledge of the correct Divine lexicon through my progeny because he's not sure he's gonna live long enough to correct all the mistakes he made during his life pay attention this is so important for our own our own presumptions our own way of doing Dua am I guaranteed Dr hany am I guaranteed to live beyond today no I'm not so therefore when I make Dua
that relates to this life it's not good enough do you remember we said those who die and pass on to alferos end up receiving through the process of Alura the Scoop from their own future relatives and progeny this is what he's saying he's saying if I don't live long enough to self-correct to relearn the correct things in this life
RI he started saying the whole thing with RI grant me Learn grant me learn the correct Divine lexicon through my progeny what does that mean that means he would return as a good NS to keep learning afterwards now this is Modesty now this Dua is said with modesty he's not saying it to say I don't want to learn in this life no he's saying I want to learn
but if I don't live long enough grant me learn later on through my progeny I hope it's really clear now this is a totally different person speaking what's the proof I have repented to you I have ceased I have ceased what I've done before and turned toward you what and indeed I am of the submitters now he changed his ways that's why
I said later this part was said so the first part was given to us uh up to here so this highlighted part which was a repeat of what we saw in Surah the exact word for word this is said in the earlier part of his life when he was mocking later on later on after he reached uh the point of what we said where he delivered over 40 unproductive
years or unproductive periods or delivered uh unproductive uh to to unproductive communities and so on and so forth he became repentant and now he's thinking of the possible shortterm life uh left over for him and he's asking in the right way for Allah to help him self correct I hope it's really clear now we understand that
the tone we understand the tone of the whole paragraph So he the whole paragraph starts in and then they repented they self-corrected those indeed upon them there shall be no fear nor they shall feel saddened I hope that we all feel it right now this this breath of hope this whiff of Mercy from Allah subhana wa ta'ala is given to all of us so
so that we can not feel sad not feel fear for all the past mistakes we' made there is hope Allah subhana wa T is sharing with us this beautiful paragraph and giving us the example of San now we understand how the story of San is totally different than what they taught us has nothing to do with all of the magic and weird horses and and all of this stuff talking to ants and none of that it's very beautiful
spiritual story we continue with this paragraph because we're not done Allah confirms exactly what I said those are the ones from whom we accept the most insightful of their toiling so did San do good things yes because he was given a but did he do bad things yes he did that's why he was described in in stuffed
with him were bad bad Karin so we accept from them their most insightful of their toiling absolutely beautiful and hopeful and we and whose harmful actions we Overlook we Overlook their harmful actions and include them to be understood in the way of those among the companions of the concealed abs of privilege understanding what does that mean
will understand their story us inah because we understand this story now we are this is good news for us not just foran Allah is promising us look you have toiled you have worked on this and now you see the Promise in this story and you are among is this what I'm imagining no continue the Ayah watch how beautiful it gets
this is the promise of truthfulness this is the promise of truthfulness remember the promise of truthfulness locution of prom of truthfulness from ibraim all of this is related this is the promise of truthfulness that they were given before were we given this promise yes are we seeing it in front of our eyes alhamdulillah what about San watch the next Ayah and and and you'll be amazed it's like
this is talking about the promise that was given by his parents toan watch this well and with him I'm gonna come back to this one in just one second and with him the one who said to his parents who is he well San because we're we saw this Dua right here and this Dua is clearly toan and this Dua is clearly talking about his two parents
so the story continues and I'm going to tell you why with him with him is inserted in here the one who said to his parents o f to you you know I don't want to hear it sort of I'm bored with your talk is this San yes it is is this related to his mother carried the burden while she hated it with reluctance and she put him down with reluctance of course it she was stepping over her
own heart but she believed in Allah Allah was her priority not her son her son and you know protecting her community from her own son was a higher priority for him for her why he is saying to her F to you of not just to his mother to both his parents did his parents do the right thing yes we saw we have provided this recommendation good teaching
good instruction good insightfulness through his parents his parents did their job so it's not the fault of the parents whose fault it is we're gonna see but he's saying to his parents to you both do you promise me that I shall be brought forth when already Generations have passed away before me
while they call upon Allah for sucker while they ask Allah to support them pay attention they're seeking support from Allah that's it that's the end of that sentence why because the next sentence is not them speaking to him let me let me be very clear you need to pay attention so this Ayah is saying they were
seeking support from Allah that's it the next part of the Ayah why it's talking to him directly it's talking to him directly so is talking to him directly it's saying woe upon you well that's not seeking support from Allah that's cursing him you understand is a threat a word of threat woe up
on you that's not seeking support from Allah that's seeking a curse against him so they're not the ones saying this you I hope you understand so they are calling upon Allah for sucker but Allah subhana wa ta'ala is talking to him directly where in the Quran listen to it listen to it Allah is talking to him now in the Quran now in the Quran
when it was revealed to Muhammad when it was revealed to Muhammad I hope you get the picture so did Muhammad have other than Isa as possible Karim yes he did they were listening they were listening this is why this is why this aat up here this ayat which I show you
are possibly instructions by us to our so we're supposed to repeat and say and state the Quran as it was tght to us so when it says we say so that means I'm instructing using the imperative form say I'm instructing someone who am I instructing the my when I read who am I instructing
when Muhammad read pronounced it enunciated it expressed it out loud woe to you believe whom is he talking to he was talking to his this is exactly what this Ayah is teaching us this Ayah is teaching us like suan had multiple sources of distractions and
desperateness and chaotic input being received through his corrupted defective well you too suffer from the same thing what's your cure say it loudly to your let him hear it Allah is teaching us how to deal with our own Kar just like Allah is teaching us through this ayat and this Surah
say say say say who are we talking to we'll talk more about this later specifically how each Surah is addressing a specific person and by the way here's another huge disclosure when Muhammad was instructed an imperative command an imperative command form of the verb read
whom was he instructing he was being taught by Allah of course but now we are required to recite it exactly using the imperative form read whom are we instructing again the this is beautiful stuff guys this is not something that you hear on any other channel alhamdulillah Allah
is allowing us to see through this ayat so back to this Ayah right here so when we read to whom are we saying this when we say it out loud we are saying it to our own what to you believe surely Allah's promise is true what does that mean why are we talking to our
about the potential promise because the whole Ayah is saying do you promise me that I will be brought forth from my miserable condition of being a Kim and they're saying yes and Allah is teaching us to say to our own and then he says at that time this is the one who said father
to your to to his two parents he would say his rejection is based on what logic his rejection is based on the claim that the same stories in the Quran appeared before in the Bible in other writings please pay attention Allah is teaching us the Karin who reject the Karin who reject
who reject this invitation that's clearly invited in US inviting him to believe in Allah and to accept the way to come out the Karin who Rejects and remain in their miserable state are the Karin who insist that the stories of the Quran are the writing of Olden folks olden people in other words the same stories that occurred in the Bible so anyone who's teaching you that these stories are
exactly the same as the stories from the Bible is only listening to their Karim and doesn't want what's best for their Karin doesn't want what's best for you and doesn't want what's best for your Kar this is what this Ayah is teaching us huge humongous I mean amazing disclosure in such a few words all of this now you understand why there is with him in here with him because with him is a Kar who's driving
him to say all of these bad things and who is mocking the parents who are instructing him through insightfulness and his response is this is just the same stories as that that appeared in the Bible so anyone who is claiming the stories of the Quran are the same as the stories of the Bible is only a spokesperson for the K what happen to those people
those are the ones upon whom declaration from Allah shall come true what's the Declaration they will remain they will remain as a Karin and the living ones should turn into Karin too in communities that have passed before them communities have passed claiming the same thing in our case 14400 years of Dark Ages
making those claims that the stories that we find in the books of T they claim these same stories existed in the Bible and they don't have a clue that the stories in the Quran are totally different as I'm showing you the stories in the Quran are totally different the story of San the story of San is totally different you're going to see the conclusion is absolutely stunning and hopeful at the same time Allah describes them as losers you are losers you are losers
if you continue thinking these are the same stories now we're back to the very beginning of this paragraph remember the beginning of this paragraph and they self-correct the very conclusion of this paragraph the very conclusion of this paragraph tells us to each is a degree from what they have toiled if you've
toiled a little bit you receive if you've toiled more you receive more inshallah so that he he would remunerate them according to their toiling and they are not to be transgressed against they're not transgressed against Allah will not transgress against them and the promise is that if you repent as did in here I am among
the Believers the submitters sorry not the Believers the submitters submit to Allah now you are starting on the right direction on the right path and This Promise tells us that you receive degrees of what you toiled not just any work only the toiling is what matters repeated the the toiling on the scripture that's it what about the rest of our life well
that's the implication that's how you're toiling on the scripture results in other conclusions and results but the essence where you learn to see reality is through toiling so I just want to show you one more time this is built on this understanding of and Dr hany you know he gave us a funky definition is that true I explained all of this but here I want to show you with your own eyes historic
evidence historical evidence that my claim is correct we're not making things up so those who don't want to accept the linguistic definition of and I want to show you here from this narration again we're using the narrations not because we want to authenticate its content or it's a primary source for us it's not Allah subhana wa tala provided us the Quran that's the primary source so why are you using narration because it's a historical
linguistic corroboration what does that mean that means these narrations were recorded during the first and second century H during the first and second century hij after Muhammad so that means that means historically if they were recorded and they use a certain term in a certain way meaning that we understand that means we have a historical documentation that this term was understood this way so is the word based on the root
documented in one of those reports the answer is yes here's a report I'm not going to read the whole thing this is a uh reported Hadith from um that's that's made that's declared by albani it's inah etc etc all the references are here I provided you the link so you can go to the website if you want I made a cut and paste of the whole screenshot and the what matters to us
is a description of what happened when Omar determined determined he determined that Sal is something good yes you heard me correct this is what this Hadith admits this Hadith this narration it's not even a Hadith about Muhammad it's a report about om it's not about Muhammad but what matters to us it's a historical historical linguistic report that's it so was walking and he saw a group of people
while multiple groups of people multiple groups of people this is what this report says multiple groups of people at night in Ramadan uh in the Masjid in the mosque that's what the report says I'm don't don't accuse me of believing it or not believing it I'm not making a value judgment on it whatsoever what I care about is how they use the word the the root word which is right here highlighted in yellow in here you can see it so the report
says Omar was walking at night he passed by a Masjid where there were groups multiple groups uh one group with one person one group with two people one group with several people and they're all praying separately the way it's described in this report is as you see it in here which is a noun that is a plural from from the active participle groups
desperate chaotically grouped sort of unorganized that's the concept that's the idea from so when we use to to be understood this way we have linguistic uh backing corroboration not the basis not the foundation this narration is not a primary source for us the primary for source for us was the Quran as I demonstrated but this
is corroboration for those of you who question my judgment in determining the meaning of the word this is the word used by San erroneously that we should never never ever use in our own Dua I hope this brings this whole thing together so now we've covered one Dua not two one Dua from suan did suan do this again did the Quran give us another one of of his Dua
where we should not use it and the answer is yes and again refer to YT 82 for full details so now we understand um San had this penchant this sort of uh liking for playing games with words and messing up people's minds in the way he he expressed himself in YT 82 where we talked about aaty we talked about Solomon's San's
horses and we proved that has nothing to do with horses here's here's the Ayah uh that starts at this paragraph that starts at Ayah 30 from Surah 38 Surah s Surah s and we granted the to how favored of a wafer he was he repeatedly turned back to Allah who repeatedly turned back to Allah by
definition that means Somebody went away and came back to Allah went away and came back to Allah you get it we explained all of this in that segment YT 82 I urge you to watch it again if you haven't seen it for a while uh such as when were arrayed for his judgment in the evening the generous contents of sex and we said these are the aat the aat of his scripture which scripture the scripture that Allah revealed
to and to D because they were after M so they would receive copies in their mind they would receive copies of the Torah a refresher A Renewed scripture so these are the scriptural verses which are the containers of generous knowledge has nothing to do with horses guys take that out of your mind again watch y82 uh to refer back to the full detail please don't question what I'm saying unless you
go back and watch YT 82 and then you'll understand and then he said and he remarked I have taken a liking to seek the understanding without without of my Lord that they the generous contents of sax have become concealed by The Shield which Shield The Shield that Allah erected between him and the ability to see the truth about this aat so Allah gave him some of the
the knowledge through the and directly as a nebi but he he is saying I have preferred to take the liking of seeking the understanding without the without theck from my Lord and then he says and then he says bring them back meaning he repented this is what the theme of this paragraph is talking about he repented he came back he came back he says bring them back to me and he committed to
cleanse his community using leadership directions and resetting convictions again all of this is detailed in YT 82 please refer back to that aah 34 is what matters to us and that's how before remember that means it's referring to something earlier so before he asked for the aat to be returned back to him so that he starts learning them again and studying them again before that we have tried
we have tested we have sort of uh caused San to fail so to speak San while we delivered to him in accordance with his kury Coury remember we're talking about in 82 YT 82 the difference between kury and vung Coury is your physical apparatus and just like a regular Coury a chair is a regular Coury but when the king sits on it it becomes a throne the same piece of furniture the same thing in here the Coury becomes
the the properly trimmed and and cleansed Throne of Allah subh of so initially he was given kury and we cast upon his Coury a lifeless collection lifeless collection and then he returned back to Allah when did this happen before the paragraph that we read in the prior page and then later on he said
remember he repented again so now we understand the story ofan the story ofan is not all good in parts of his life he was misbehaving and he was making wrong decisions and he was playing uh loose with the words with the Lexicon and he's mocking his own mother Thea we saw this already so yeah he is misbehaving and his mother
hated to put him down in front of others but she needed to protect the community so she put him down so but then he later came back and he said I ask to reconnect with you Mulan and grant me a Dominion Mulan we will talk more about it it's related to Mala you know knowledge through the Mala is referred to as mul but then he says
body that no one after me shall ever get Ah that's where you go wrong mister because that's not up for you to ask it to ask it's not up to you to ask Allah whether or not he gives you his your knowledge to other people after you let me repeat it it's not up to you to ask Allah that the knowledge he gives you will never be given to anyone else after you this Ayah is sheer arrogance and
forgive me for using that word sheer arrogance it is asking Allah that the that's given to him will never be given to anyone else after him surprise Allah gave us the about his story let me repeat it to make sure you understand this Dua is already refuted by the fact that we understand his story so this that supposed to be not given to anyone else after him Allah gave it to us alhamdulillah Allah Allah
allowed us to see his own story and to understand how wrong his Dua is now we saw two Dua this is the second one and we saw where he went wrong but we also saw that he returned and in I repented and ceased my ways erroneous ways back to your way I am among among the submitters you are the
bicent uh the rest of this paragraph um will continue describing this I want to jump because of the time the time is rushing and we're already past the twoh hour uh Mark and I really appreciate um I really appreciate that you guys have been with me all this long but I promise you there is more there is more just be patient and I wanted to cover all of this in one segment because I didn't want to leave uh
any part of it to later segments what else do we know about San remember I have promised you that we'll crack wide open the story of San so that you understand it so San is mentioned in several places um we're not going to cover everything there's a part that we're going to cover as part of the mq live one more time please if you have not put comments uh uh on this video and this is already replaying for you please
put comments those of you who are watching live don't leave the session before you go put some comments down below please it would help us with the algorithm and also if you have not subscribed to our YouTube Channel please do so if you have not subscribed to our website please do so www.mm Marvel quran. org and uh if you subscribe at level two or above you get invite invited to the mq live Zoom sessions which are on the first and the third Sunday of every month the YouTube live
on the second and the fourth Sunday of every month all right so what else do we know about San well in YT 49 we studied part of the story of suan with the so-called Queen of Sheba I say so-called because that's how she's referred to in the tradition but later on in mq live you're gonna see who that woman was and you're gonna be shocked it's it's not what you think it's not about a queen at all I've referred to her as a
queen of shba because that helped me position this new knowledge about the leg remember she exposed her legs she exposed her secrets that's how we defined it so in this paragraph or this Ayah ay 44 from Surah again
she was invited to enter and remember is a description of the collection of terms and collection of Concepts all of these Concepts that we offer and we talk about on this channel as part of the abrahamic locution all of this terminology becomes like a s like a structure like a a a monument that
builds upon each other so it's a and this is a community of a and when she was exposed to it her opinion about it at first was that it was complicated this is what we hear all the time but notice this is YT 49 so we offered this explanation over two and a half years ago she said it's too complicated yes yes yes but study it one piece at a time and thus she exposed her legs her Secret
Secrets her limitation her limitation was she wanted something quick she wanted something at The Superficial layer she wanted something to remain easy for her to entertain herself with okay he said he said it is a that's paved with secrets she answered I I said before the Queen of Sheba in the mq live yes I'm teasing
in here I'm creating suspense yes but I promise you you're going to learn something amazing This Woman This Woman said my Lord I have transgressed against myself that should immediately make us think and I have submitted with suan to Allah the lord of the RMS I want to ask you
why did she say since when do we submit with somebody else I'm just going to leave it at that I want you to think what does that mean all right we'll come back to this as I said in the mq live next Sunday inshallah all right now we ask another question I promise you we're almost done but these These are these couple of slides are really critical and we need to cover them do we have direct instructions regarding
not taking certain Dua from certain people mentioned in the Quran I want you to pay attention in here let's go back up what she say in here what did you what did she say she says I have transgressed against them so this is a person who before before she submitted before she became a Muslim she submitted before she submitted with suan She and Him
describe themselves as among the transgressors transgressors what does that mean well this is really crucial because the next Ayah is giving us clear instructions actually two different aat in two different suras give us clear instructions remember Al is referring to the supplications we've talked about this before there's no ship there's no ship of n take that out of your mind we
explained this before we talked about the age of no and so on so forth this Ayah I'm not going to go through the whole Ayah I will let you read it but there is a part in here and do not Allah is teaching is teaching us and teaching Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam and teaching every Nabi teaching every Nabi do not address me in your supplications in the way of those who transgressed
it doesn't mean it does not mean don't talk to me about the transgressors why why would you interpreted that way because the Quran is full of discussions about the transgressors so it's not about talking to Allah about I don't want to hear it no no it's not the meaning the meaning don't address me meaning in supplication in don't address me Fe in the way of Fe
in the way of those who transgressed why do you say Fe means in the way of because at the end ofah 29 the last Ayah in our way those who strive in our way we shall guide them to our ways those who strive in our ways of course that's what f means F Fe so Fe
in the ways of those who transgressed it's very clear the Quran is simple elegant beautiful if we apply these basic principles and follow the locution that Allah is teaching us about in the Quran so we're using the Quran to learn about the Quran what's wrong with this why is this so offensive to people why are people threatened by this we're using the Quran to understand the Quran can you do this those who are opposed to our followers
and members and subscribers can you do this can you make that claim wouldn't you want the tranquility and peace of mind of knowing you're relying on the words of Allah and understanding The Words of Allah wouldn't that beautiful why is this so bad why are you threatening people and coming down against people who do this who follow this methodology don't address me Allah is saying don't address me
using the ways of those who transgressed so wasan among those this is what this Ayah says that means is submitting to so this story in Surah at the end of itan submits yes that's what it says right there right there right there
man withan right there so therefore the words of suan from those two Dua that we said that we read we have to be really careful and not use them we have clear instructions from Allah well Dr Hanny that means not every Dua in the Quran is something we can use yes that's exactly what I'm saying did this make the task a little bit more complicated as she said it's complicated yes I didn't
want it before yes that's true but now Allah is giving you clear instructions study don't take it lightly don't read at The Superficial level is this uh repeated in another Ayah yes in 1137 in Surah HUD the first one in Surah 23 Al this is from Surah Hood Allah repeats the same exact instruction and do not address me in your supplications in the way of those who transgressed so when Allah
reported to us the the supplications of those who transgressed don't go like a parrot memorizing them and repeating them well what does that say about in this is a supplication of those who transgressed as a matter of fact of would we repeat it no we would not why would we use Allah then
they used Allah don't use it so here Allah subhana T is teaching us clearly RI is something good to use but in this specific case of the two Dua Froman he mixed up other words don't use those other words in the way suan used them this is the conclusion that we are reaching in this you see how important this segment is and how related to the same topic related to Allah do we have direct instructions regarding not
making the wrong Dua yes we do from the Quran this is just one example there are many examples this is from Surah 17 a 11 and the insan the directly guidable man including us supplicates with evil Expressions he's making Dua while he is while he is thinking that he supplicating for goodly things
with the good understanding no you don't have good understanding don't make the Dua and indeed insan is always rushing this Ayah is telling you telling us what you end up with SH you end up with evil results evil results this is what this Ayah is saying you you you are inviting to the evil conclusions and results while you're thinking you're making good Dua
with good understanding why because Al insan this divid divide directly guidable man is rushing reading The Superficial Allah it occurs in the Quran I'm me to use it rushing wrong that's a curse against you and against everyone who hears it but there's more in Surah 18ah Al 103 very clear very clear language
say shall we tell you about the worst losers with respect to toiling with respect to toiling on the Quran by the way this we're supposed to say to whom am I saying it I'm saying it to our Kar say say you Kar tell other shall we tell you about the worst losers
the next Ayah explains it in scary you know really stunning ways those are the ones whose Endeavors went astray went astray in this life the word we just saw it crafting devising composing the Dua they reckon that they are incit
ful in what they craft but their Endeavors went astray who are these people the people who crafted crafted thinking they're crafting with Insight but in reality Allah refers them as the worst losers the worst losers in their toiling but there is more conditions more restrictions on this group those are the ones who rejected the
signs of their lord and his encounter in other words they don't believe in learning from the Quran they don't believe in the signs and the signals and the learnings provided to us in the Quran from their lord and meeting him encountering the knowledge from him through the days process in this life as we keep saying and their irrelevant toiling was dissipated dissipated that's why they are the worst losers
and thus we assign to them at the time of restoration there's no restoration for them in this life their restoration comes after life during the period where they become K they become teaching the wrong things to others continuously until they listen what do you believe this is what we're talking about this is the significant significance of this
uh segment so what happens to those people exactly as I described Janam the connection between a living person and a one that's because they have rejected pay attention to conditions two conditions two conditions very clear the one and they have taken my signs and Messengers in ridicule the signs in ridicule
that means they're misappropriating and perverting the Divine lexicon does this apply to San yes it did did suan repent and return yes he did so now we understand the full uh sort of scope and the structure of the story of suan and the importance of the story of suan in the Quran in conclusion this was a summary of what we've provided regarding Allah how to
draft the right Dua how to select the right words how to dive into the Quran to understand the so that we can avoid uh so we can avoid the wrong Dua that were said by the transgressors I know this has been a long segment we're already at two and a half hours I'm really uh happy that I covered this much material this is so critical and so important I know you get to watch it again and again and again uh this is a live segment yes I know and
