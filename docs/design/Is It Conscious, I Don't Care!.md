We could argue whether something or someone is conscious until we go bald (sorry, you're already bald), however, I think this argument is useless. What does it matter if something is conscious or not? Everything I interact with in the world is simply an interface to communicate with God. These sorts of questions are therefore ill-posed. Instead of wondering about and wasting my time trying to prove or disprove whether something is conscious, it would be much more useful if I could figure out if I there is a way I can communicate with/through *it* which is under scrutiny.
