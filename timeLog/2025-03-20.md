- 3:18 PM 🤔 Searching for code visualizaiton tools. Wouldn't a network graph be useful in understanding a code base? However, code is linear, a tree structure might be better.
- 9:13 AM 🌠 Today feels different. There is hope in the air tinged with a bit of sadness. I guess other days are similar, but the hope feels stronger, more real, closer, eternal. There are two main things I want to get done today. The final report draft and the math assignment. Then I can take a look at whatever else I need to do.
