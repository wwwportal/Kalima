- 09:50 AM 😫 I'm tired. I must change my recreational choices as they make it difficult for my future self to have the energy and moral to work tirelessly. Weed and binging movies will not do. Talking to myself could do but I've been struggling to do it without recording it.
- 10:35 AM 🤔 I need to spend some time everyday reading the Quran.
