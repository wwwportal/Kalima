- 1:18 PM 🛀 It's a saturday. I stayed up late yesterday watching Sherlock Holmes with my sisters. I feel pretty well-rested. There's still a lot of work to do, but I feel like I can manage. Today I'd like to finish the *Evaluation of Criteria* section of the final report and get started on OOP *Assignment 2*.
- 1:47 PM 🧑‍💼 Let's start with Assignment 2.
