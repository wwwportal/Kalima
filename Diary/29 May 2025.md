## Intentions
- [ ] Finish C Lab 2

## Time Log
[9:55] Spent a few hours working on the C lab 2. It's pretty hard but I think it's slowly coming along. Finding and writing a solution is more about my ability to work on the problem for a long time without burining out, so I need to find a better ways to take breaks in between one or more hours of intense focus.
[10:53] Made some progress with the C lab 2. I should be able to finish it today. I might even have time to finish it and make some progress on some of the other labs I need to complete.
[12:41] I got tired and didn't do much work.

## Barriers
1. Not writing a day log makes me less focused.
2. Smoking makes me feel tired. Eating makes me feel better.

## Insights
1. Leaving my laptop outside of my room helps me sleep better and wake up early the next day.
2. Finding and writing a solution is more about my ability to work on the problem for a long time without burining out, so I need to find a better ways to take breaks in between one or more hours of intense focus.
3. Eat more often.
