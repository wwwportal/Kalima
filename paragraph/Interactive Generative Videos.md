What is the purpose of having interactive generative videos (IGV)? To be able to play infinite story game with stylistic flexibility, generate educational settings to throw students in a live simulation of cell biology, or crowd control? That would certainly be cool, but would it be the best justification and use of this technology? Let's explore more questions on the implications of IGV.

Some papers mention the use of IGV for embodied autonomous systems. Modern ai training methods do poorly with tasks with very few examples the AI model can learn from. IGVs would serve as training tools with the ability to generate accurate simulationa of under-reperesented training scenarios in the original model's training data.

The potential result is a constantly evolving virtual world.

For some reason, I am compelled to see the potential benefit IGV systems could have in bringing a community together. To this end, I think Mixed Reality (MR) and Augmented Reality (AR) will play a crucial role. That is, the IGV will use and combine both the user's physical and informational environment together, enabling the user to interact with both seamlessly.
