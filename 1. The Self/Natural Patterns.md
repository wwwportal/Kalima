## Introduction: The Obsession with Patterns

I am obsessed with patterns. As time goes on, I find myself more interested in abstract patterns that are grounded in evidence-based data. However, I find myself distressed by the number of different fields. I don't know what kind of data I should analyze, and I don't want to get stuck in a single subfield. What if there could be a way to analyze any sort of data. A sort of meta-analysis method. Maybe neural networks. Something universal will probably remain out of reach for a few thousands of years, so I still need to narrow down my interests. I have already decided that communication networks are one of my core interests, but this is still too broad a category.

What rules lead to the formation of these patterns? They can all be found in nature. They represent the solidification of a pattern of communication between interlocuting organisms. Path-finding behaviors depend on the density of the individual and its environment/medium. The density of the medium depends on the relationships between its constituent parts. This seems to be true for all scales.

## Nature's Morphological Complexity

Nature is filled with patterns. Recently I began a systematic identification of the patterns I found appealing, and went down a bit of a dizzying rabbit hole. I noticed a pattern in my growing collection of patterns, but as soon as I expanded my collection to include other patterns in nature, I became overwhelmed by the level of complexity in nature.

I started out with roots, veins, fractals, moss, mold, slime mold, bone marrow, fascia, spider webs (and other kinds of webs), thorny vines, electrical discharges, intestines, succulent cacti, certain types of microorganisms, computer circuits and wiring and the sort. These all have morphological similarities. I went in to add forms with thicker bodies like mushrooms, sea creatures, insects, corals, crystals, and other more complex systems.

At this point, I got a glimpse of the scale of what I was trying to do. It would be impossible for me to find general patterns that exhaust the morphological lexicon of nature. If we take all scales in consideration, the combinations are practically endless. I haven't lost hope, but I know this calls for a change of direction in my research.

## Clarifying the Purpose

First, I needed to understand the purpose of my research. What am I trying to accomplish? Most of the time, my research is driven by a deep intuition that I can very only verbalize precisely with great difficulty, so I will keep it vague. It goes something like the following. Each thing does not necessarily logically follow from the next. This is more of a tapestry of ideas.

## Communication, Density, and Environment

What rules lead to the formation of these patterns? They can all be found in nature. They represent the solidification of a pattern of communication between interlocuting organisms. Path-finding behaviors depend on the density of the individual and its environment/medium. The density of the medium depends on the relationships between its constituent parts. This seems to be true for all scales (Ball, 2009; Camazine et al., 2001).

This observation aligns closely with **complex systems theory**, where global order arises from local interactions. The communication patterns of slime molds or social insects, for instance, exhibit emergent behaviors that cannot be reduced to the rules of individual components. These examples resonate with the core of **biosemiotics**, which interprets life as a series of sign-based interactions, where even cellular structures carry and interpret information much like language.

In addition, **cybernetics**—particularly second-order cybernetics—emphasizes feedback loops and recursive self-regulation. My intuition that organisms define themselves through interactions is mirrored in the cybernetic model of self-observing systems. Feedback is not simply external but becomes constitutive of the system's identity.

## Recursive Ontology of Form and Function

### In Formal Logic
To formalize the recursive structure, we present a series of propositions:

1. Let $T$ be a "thing."
2. Each $T$ has a form $F_T$ and a function $Φ_T$.
3. $F_T \leftrightarrow Φ_T$: Form and function are co-defining.
4. $Φ_T$ arises from a state of affairs $S$, which also has its own $F_S, Φ_S$.
5. $Φ_T$ can only be defined from a perspective $P$, which is a structured set of other $T_i$.
6. $P$ itself has a form $F_P$ and function $Φ_P$, and is thus subject to recursive application of (1).
7. $∃ T^* \subset T$ such that $T^*$ is self-defining: $T^* \approx P(T^*)$.
8. This $T^*$ is autopoietic, and its environment $E$ becomes a function of $T^*$.
9. Multiple $T^*_i \in E$ define themselves in relation to each other, forming a network $N$.
10. Perception $π(T)$ is bounded by $F_T$.
11. For interoperability, $∀ T_i, T_j \in N, ∃ M$ such that $Φ_{T_i}, Φ_{T_j} \rightarrow M$.
12. All $T \rightarrow F_T, Φ_T$, with $Φ_T \rightarrow G$ where $G$ is a goal or telos.

### In Prose
Form is equivalent to function (Thompson, 1917).
Function implicates purpose.
Purpose is teleonomic (Mayr, 1974).
The function of a thing is the reaction to a state of affairs.
The state of affairs has a form.
The state of affairs has a function.
The function of a thing can be defined from a number of perspectives (Dennett, 1991).
One perspective can define a number of functions to a thing.
Perspective is composed of a number of things.
A set of things is a thing.
A perspective has a form.
A perspective has a function.
The function of a perspective can only be determined from a different perspective.
The function of a thing can only be defined from another thing.

These reflections parallel concepts in **information theory**, where the meaning of a signal is dependent on context, entropy, and the relationship between sender and receiver. As in **machine learning**, especially in unsupervised pattern recognition, function emerges from structure without explicit instruction, supporting the idea that form and function co-determine one another across levels.

## The Emergence of the Autopoetic Self

There exists a thing that can define itself.
The self is a state of affairs.
The function of this thing is to refine its self-definition. Call it the autopoetic (Maturana & Varela, 1980).
Autopoetic has an environment that it must interact with.
The environment is a set of things.
Autopoetic defines itself through interacting with its environment.
Its environment becomes part of its self-identification.
There are other autopoetics in the environment.
Autopoetics begin to define themselves based on each other that they can perceive (Bateson, 1972).

Here, **autopoiesis** converges with **systems biology**, which investigates how systems maintain internal coherence while adapting to external stimuli. The notion that identity emerges relationally also finds a home in **relational ontology**, a philosophical stance gaining traction in ecological and feminist theory.

## Constraints of Perception and the Role of Holons

Perception is limited by form.
Form is function.
Function is holonic (Koestler, 1967).
For all functions to be interoperable, there must be a common medium.
A common medium implicates a common environment.
The environment is a thing.
The environment has a form.
The environment has a function.
The environment as a whole is one.

The holonic structure of function aligns with **hierarchical models** in both computation and cognition, where nested levels of abstraction interact without collapsing into a single explanatory layer. This also resonates with **modularity in neural networks**, where specialized sub-networks contribute to unified behavior, mimicking the holon: both a part and a whole.

## Function, Mind, and Evolution

Form is function.
Function is non-physical.
Non-physical is mental.
All is mind (James, 1902).
All has function.
All has form.
A thing's form must be a part of the whole's form.
Things are not static.
Since function is teleonomic, then a thing must seek something.
A thing seeks something.
Something has a form.
Something has a function.
Things seek function.
By doing so, they change form.

The recursive drive to seek and transform reflects principles found in **evolutionary computation**, where each entity adapts by shifting structure in response to a fitness function. The connection between function and mind evokes **panpsychism** and certain interpretations of **integrated information theory**, positing that consciousness—or at least proto-cognitive function—is inherent in form.
