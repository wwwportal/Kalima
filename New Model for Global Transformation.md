Context: This paper emerged out of a dialogue with an argumentative part of myself who insists on creating increasingly comprehensive human control systems as the only way to bring about global order. He doesn't want to admit it but his attachment to this perspective is due to his desire to get credit (recognition, praise, etc) for the resulting change. His masking argument is that

The current and most prevalent model for global transformation revolves around direct human control through laws and enforcement—essentially, a system where compliance is compelled through man-made systems of governance.

However, the new understanding of the Network of Anfus (NOA) enables a radically different approach. Instead of external enforcement, this model leverages the executive abilities of Allah, the lord of the 'realms', using the Malaika, for effecting real change in the cognition of earthlings and by consequence in their organizational systems.

This is achieved, from the perspective of an earthling, through the initiation and maintenance of an interdimensional collaboration with the NOA through the invocation of correct 'program calls' crafted in the standard language employed in the higher echelons of the NOA, i.e., the Abrahamic Locution (AL). Correct programs calls must accurately reflect the unlocking patterns for the programs 'stored' in the Governance. For, this reflection (or resonance) is the key prerequisite to making these programs accessible to the Anfus, initiating the much needed rectification of their weltanschauung.

Let me clarify this with two simple geometrical models.
One earthling trying to help many other earthlings. This is not scalable.
One earthling connecting with Allah, activating a cascading effect of change from the NOA all the way down to Jaheem.
This embodies the principle of "think globally, act locally." By becoming a skilled and habitual caller, in addition to increasing self-coherence, one becomes a living example for those watching from above, ground-level and from below.

Resistance to change brought about this way is ultimately futile. As fewer Anfus/Nufoos remain to reinforce outdated behaviors and cognitive patterns, opportunities for self-destructive actions diminish. With dwindling support, individuals lose the resources or encouragement to perpetuate negative habits.

Thus, by focusing on one’s relationship with Allah and allowing this internal process to unfold, global change can be achieved indirectly. Without direct effort to enforce transformation based on incomprehensive protocols formulated by severely lacking humans, individuals become catalysts for systemic evolution simply by aligning with this spiritual framework.
