For the past 1400 years, the Islamic body of knowledge has been largely based on appeals to authority and tradition. Interpretations became established upon the transmitted reports of Muhammad, although more than 90% of the Quran has been left unexplained by him, and most if not all the clues he left us are cryptic.

Ali Ibn Ahmed Ibn Ibrahim Al-Maha'imi (d. 1432) was the first to take a systematic intra-Quranic approach to Quran interpretation. Before that, most Muslim scholars would interpolate the meaning of Quranic narratives based on the similarities that they held with ancient wisdom that they knew and loved, and less on making sure the their way of understanding the words was consistent for all instances.

A full concordance of the Quranic roots/word forms really only appears in the late 19th-early 20th century, with works like Flugel's Concordantiae Coranic Arabicae (1842) and Muhammad Fu'ad 'Abd al-Baqi's al-Mu'jam al-Mufahras li-Alfaz al-Quran, (1945). It was therefore difficult before that to systematically verify the validity of their perceived meaning of a word for all its instances. And consistency is necessary of a coherent text. 

In some cases, the context in which the word is found makes a chosen meaning awkward, so they looked for another meaning that would fit better in that instance. They referred to the life of the prophet and biblical stories as sources of understanding. When a story was "obviously" the same as its seemingly prophetic or biblical counterpart, then it was obvious to understand it in that context. This was the focus. So when they came upon the Chapter of Yusuf, this is what they saw:

a. [رَٰوَدَتْهُ] --> [seduce]
b. [غَلَّقَتِ ٱلۡأَبۡوَٰبَ] --> [she locked the doors]
c. [إِنْ هَٰذَآ إِلَّا مَلَكٞ كَرِيمٞ] --> [he could be but an angel] --> [handsome]
d. [ٱلسِّجۡن] --> [prison]

[a,b,c,d] --> [Joseph and Potiphar's wife]

# Show how a different conclusion can be reached if these assumptions are not made in the first place.

# Show how this same phenomenon is applicable for practically all ayat in the Quran.

# Show that Dr.Hany, in his Marvelous Quran youtube channel shows plenty examples of this phenomenon, including the importance of supporting this effort to give the Quran its due diligence, highlighting the challenges the muslim community has consequently faced over the past few millenia.

# Share an optimisitic vision of a future where applying this methodology has become prevalent.
